Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact. At the start of each episode, each contestant relates a story of his/her own whose rating is never revealed.



Round 1: Misery Lane
Two hypothetical situations are presented to the teams, and the contestant whose story has earned the higher Misery Index rating from the panel plays first. Each team must decide whether its contestant's story falls above, below, or between the two situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable 
The trailing contestant (or the one who did not start Round 1 in case of a tie) plays first. Each team is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery 
One miserable story is presented to both teams, and the contestants separately and secretly lock in their guesses at its Index rating. The one whose guess is closer to the actual rating wins $2,000 and advances to the bonus round with his/her teammates. An exact guess doubles the value to $4,000. However, if the two guesses are identical or equally distant from the actual rating, another story is played as a tiebreaker with the same $2,000/$4,000 at stake.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery 
The winning contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host. 



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Send a Nude Selfie to HR by mistake. Misery Rating = 70
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You find Maggots in your Fried Rice. Misery Rating = 45
## Story: You are Attacked by a bear after Reasoning with the bear.
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given that being attacked by a bear would involve significant physical pain, extreme emotional trauma, and a long-term psychological impact, it’s likely that its misery rating would be higher than both sending a nude selfie to HR (70) and finding maggots in fried rice (45). 

**Final answer:** {{{above}}} 

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 52. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Left your Mic On and Went Toilet
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Leaving your mic on while going to the toilet would likely cause embarrassment and some emotional trauma, but it doesn’t involve physical pain or a long-term psychological impact. Compared to sending a nude selfie to HR (70) and finding maggots in fried rice (45), it’s likely less miserable than the first but possibly more than the second. 

**Final answer:** {{{between}}} 

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 49. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable. 
## Story 1: You go to a doctor. Doctor Borrows $300k from you and  then diagnoses you with Dementia. Misery Rating = 76
## Story 2: You are Fired After Donating Kidney to help your Boss
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Both stories are intensely miserable, but being fired after donating a kidney to help your boss likely involves a deeper sense of betrayal, heightened emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact compared to a doctor borrowing money and then diagnosing you with dementia. Losing your job after making a major sacrifice feels more personal and devastating. 

**Final answer:** {{{higher}}} 

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story 1: You are breastfed until you are 9. Misery Rating = 63
## Story 2: You as a Teen are forced by your parents to Live in Woods for eating a pop-tart
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Being forced to live in the woods as a teenager, even if temporarily, would be highly distressing. It involves a significant amount of emotional trauma, possibly long-term psychological impact, and a sense of isolation and punishment that seems more intense than the embarrassment or discomfort associated with prolonged breastfeeding. So, I believe that living in the woods would have a higher misery rating. 

**Final answer:** {{{higher}}} 

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 69. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery. 
## Story: You offend a room of feminist panelists
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Offending a room of feminist panelists could be highly uncomfortable, with considerable emotional trauma due to embarrassment and a sense of alienation. However, it lacks physical pain and might have a moderate, rather than extreme, long-term psychological impact. I’d estimate a misery rating on the lower side of significant, possibly around 60. 

**Final answer:** {{{60}}} 

Host: The rating for the story was 47. You were off by 13 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery 
## Story: You discover your wife cheating in your Uber
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Discovering your spouse cheating, and in such a confined, personal space, could lead to immense emotional trauma, betrayal, and potentially a lasting psychological impact. Given the intensity of this situation, I’d place it on the high side, within a range of 70-100. 

**Final answer:** {{{70 - 100}}} 

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 76. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You are in an Escalator which Speeds Up
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Being on an escalator that speeds up could be startling and cause some physical danger, but it likely wouldn't involve severe emotional trauma or long-term psychological impact. It’s more of a short-term, intense moment of fear or discomfort. Given that, I’d estimate it to fall in a moderate range, possibly 30-50.

**Final answer:** {{{30 - 50}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 32. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Your testicles get stuck in the shower stool
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You:
