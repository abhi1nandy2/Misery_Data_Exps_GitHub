Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.
