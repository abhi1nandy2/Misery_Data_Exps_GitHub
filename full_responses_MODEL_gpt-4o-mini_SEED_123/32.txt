Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Proctologist Tells You They Love You. Misery Rating = 36
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Your Wife Is having sex with the Weatherman. Misery Rating = 75
## Story: Your Son has sex with His Car
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the context of the ratings and the nature of the stories, I would place "Your Son has sex with His Car" as more miserable than the proctologist incident but less miserable than the wife cheating with the weatherman. 

Thus, I believe the story falls between the two hypothetical situations.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Your Bump N' Grind Burns You
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To analyze "Your Bump N' Grind Burns You," I consider the ratings and the nature of the misery in comparison to the two hypothetical situations. 

- The first situation, "Proctologist Tells You They Love You," has a rating of 36.
- The second situation, "Your Wife Is having sex with the Weatherman," has a rating of 75.

With these in mind, "Your Bump N' Grind Burns You" likely relates to a more physical and perhaps painfully humorous context, possibly involved with a higher rate of misery than the proctologist incident, but the degree of emotional trauma might not be as high as infidelity.

After considering the nature of the stories, I would place "Your Bump N' Grind Burns You" above the first situation (36) but likely below the second situation (75).

Thus, my final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 52. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Head Gets Stuck in Stair Railing Mid-Railing after you tried to spice things up. Misery Rating = 60
## Story 2: You mistakenly became a getaway driver after a first date ended with a bank robbery
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To compare the misery ratings of the two stories, I will consider their contexts:

- **Story 1**: "Your Head Gets Stuck in Stair Railing Mid-Railing after you tried to spice things up" has a Misery Rating of 60, which likely indicates a funny but physically humorous situation with some level of embarrassment and discomfort.
  
- **Story 2**: "You mistakenly became a getaway driver after a first date ended with a bank robbery" seems to present a much more serious situation involving crime, potential legal consequences, and the emotional trauma of such an experience.

Given the serious nature of Story 2 versus the relatively light-hearted nature of Story 1, I would deduce that Story 2 likely has a higher misery rating due to the emotional and psychological implications of being involved in a robbery.

Thus, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 77. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Your Boyfriend Slept with Your Mom while on his way to meeting her. Misery Rating = 66
## Story 2: Your Son is Dating a Cockroach for a year
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To compare the misery ratings of the two stories, I will analyze their contexts:

- **Story 1**: "Your Boyfriend Slept with Your Mom while on his way to meeting her" carries a Misery Rating of 66. This scenario combines significant emotional trauma, betrayal, and the potential for long-term psychological impact stemming from familial relationships.
  
- **Story 2**: "Your Son is Dating a Cockroach for a year" presents a more absurd and humorous situation, which likely lessens the emotional and psychological weight compared to Story 1, even though it could still be viewed as socially awkward or distressing.

Considering the severe emotional implications of Story 1 versus the lighter-hearted absurdity of Story 2, it is reasonable to conclude that Story 1 likely has a higher misery rating.

Thus, my final answer is {{{lower}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 55. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: An Entire Stadium of People Hates You
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To estimate the misery rating for the story "An Entire Stadium of People Hates You," I will consider the social implications and psychological impact of such a scenario. 

Being hated by a large group of people can lead to significant emotional trauma, feelings of isolation, shame, and long-term psychological consequences like anxiety or depression. 

Taking these factors into account, I would rate this scenario quite high on the misery scale, likely in the range of 80 to 90.

After careful consideration, my final answer is {{{85}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 42. You were off by 43 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Your Pastor is Caught Having Sexy-Time
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the rating for "Your Pastor is Caught Having Sexy-Time," I will consider the potential social and emotional ramifications involved in such a scenario. This situation could likely evoke a range of reactions including scandal, embarrassment, and betrayal, especially considering the religious context.

Given the nature of other stories, I would place the rating somewhere in the mid-range, likely around 50 (with a possible margin that reflects the emotional impact and societal context). Thus, if I estimate the rating to be around 50, with the specified margin of 30, I will calculate the interval:

- **LOWER LEVEL**: 50 - 30 = 20
- **HIGHER LEVEL**: 50 + 30 = 80

Thus, my final answer is {{{20 - 80}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 58. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Husband Virtually Kills You
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the rating for "Your Husband Virtually Kills You," I will consider the implications of such a situation. This scenario suggests a significant emotional and psychological impact, as it involves betrayal, feelings of insecurity, and potential long-term effects on mental health. Given the severity of the situation, I would estimate the rating to be high.

Taking into account similar stories and the emotional weight of this narrative, I would place the rating around 75. With the specified margin of 20, I will calculate the interval:

- **LOWER LEVEL**: 75 - 20 = 55
- **HIGHER LEVEL**: 75 + 20 = 95

Thus, my final answer is {{{55 - 95}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 35. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You fell into water & inadvertently got kicked in the face after trying to propose to your girlfriend while she was on a motorboat
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the rating for the story "You fell into water & inadvertently got kicked in the face after trying to propose to your girlfriend while she was on a motorboat," I will take into account the circumstances surrounding the event. 

This scenario suggests a humorous mishap that involves physical pain from being kicked in the face as well as emotional embarrassment from the failed proposal attempt. While there may be initial emotional trauma, the overall situation seems more comical than severely miserable.

Given these factors, I would estimate the rating to be around 40. With the specified margin of 10, I will calculate the interval:

- **LOWER LEVEL**: 40 - 10 = 30
- **HIGHER LEVEL**: 40 + 10 = 50

Thus, my final answer is {{{30 - 50}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 51. Thank you for playing!
