Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Glass Thermometer Shatters in Your Mouth. Misery Rating = 58
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Your Feet Appear on a Fetish Website. Misery Rating = 30
## Story: A Snake Bites Your Face
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the situations you've provided, the snake bite seems to involve significant physical pain and potential long-term psychological effects, which could place its misery rating higher than the situation where someone's feet appear on a fetish website, but possibly lower than the 58 rating of a glass thermometer shattering in someone's mouth. Therefore, I would place this story as falling between the two situations.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 62. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Pass Out on Live TV
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Considering the two hypothetical situations, passing out on live TV would likely cause significant embarrassment and emotional trauma, possibly rated higher than the situation involving feet on a fetish website. However, it may not exceed the degree of misery associated with a glass thermometer shattering in one's mouth, which involves direct physical pain. I would assess this story to be between the two situations.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 44. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You are a patient with bizarre form of amnesia and you feel like you are still in 2005 after a routine dental treatment. Misery Rating = 83
## Story 2: You're Trapped in a Coma for 12 Years
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Both stories involve significant emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact. However, being trapped in a coma for 12 years seems to suggest an overwhelmingly greater level of misery due to the extreme deprivation of conscious experience and quality of life, which likely ranks it higher than the bizarre form of amnesia experienced after dental treatment. 

Therefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 85. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You're Addicted to Cat Fur. Misery Rating = 57
## Story 2: An Octopus is Stuck on Your Face
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: In comparing the two stories, being addicted to cat fur could cause emotional distress, but it does not seem as immediately painful or distressing as having an octopus stuck on your face, which likely causes significant physical pain and potential embarrassment. Therefore, I would anticipate that the octopus scenario has a higher misery rating.

My final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 49. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You're Forced to Go Skydiving
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Considering the potential for intense fear, emotional trauma, and the pressure of being forced to do something as extreme as skydiving, I would estimate the misery rating to be relatively high but not at the top end of the scale. Given these factors, I would guess the rating for this story is around 70.

My final answer is {{{70}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 35. You were off by 35 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You are a woman who has 44 Kids by age 36
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Given the extraordinary circumstances of a woman having 44 kids by age 36, I can foresee significant emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological effects from such an overwhelming responsibility. I would estimate that the misery rating for this story may be higher due to the stress and challenges posed by this situation. 

Taking into consideration the margin of error of 30 points, I would estimate the misery rating somewhere between 50 and 80. 

My final answer is {{{50 - 80}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 74. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Bus Breaks in Half at the middle while you are standing in the back
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Considering the scenario where a bus breaks in half while someone is standing in the back, there could be significant physical danger, potential injury, and emotional trauma associated with such an unexpected and alarming event. Given the level of misery this situation entails and the margin of error of 20 points, I would estimate the misery rating to be between 50 and 70.

My final answer is {{{50 - 70}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 45. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Have a Fork in Your Penis that is surgically removed
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Considering the extremely painful and potentially traumatic scenario of having a fork in one's penis that requires surgical removal, this situation likely involves significant physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact. Given the severity of the situation and the margin of error of 10 points, I would estimate the misery rating to be quite high. Therefore, I would suggest a range between 80 and 90.

My final answer is {{{80 - 90}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 80. Thank you for playing!
