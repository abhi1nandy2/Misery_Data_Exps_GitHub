Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Wake up Covered in Fire Ants. Misery Rating = 68
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Your Partner Screams Their Ex's Name During Sex. Misery Rating = 37
## Story: Your Mom Marries Your Son
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the two hypothetical situations, I would evaluate the emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact associated with the story "Your Mom Marries Your Son". It would likely be rated above the misery level of 37 (your partner screaming their ex’s name during sex) due to the profound betrayal and complexity of relationships involved, but potentially below the 68 rating of waking up covered in fire ants, which can imply severe physical pain. Therefore, I would classify the story as being between the two situations.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 76. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Are Impaled Ta-Dah!
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: For the story "You Are Impaled Ta-Dah!", I need to evaluate the physical pain involved. Impalement is likely to cause extreme physical pain, which would suggest a higher misery rating. Given the first hypothetical situation (waking up covered in fire ants with a misery rating of 68) and the second hypothetical situation (partner screaming their ex's name during sex with a rating of 37), I would conclude that being impaled would surpass the 68 rating due to the severity of the physical pain it entails.

Therefore, my final answer is {{{above}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 64. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Husband Fakes Death to Avoid Paying You. Misery Rating = 41
## Story 2: Your Husband Wins lottery and Leaves You
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: For the stories presented, I need to compare the emotional and financial impact of each situation. 

In Story 1, "Your Husband Fakes Death to Avoid Paying You," there's a level of psychological trauma from the betrayal and the financial consequences, resulting in a misery rating of 41. 

In Story 2, "Your Husband Wins Lottery and Leaves You," there is a similar element of betrayal. However, winning the lottery could entail a mix of initial joy and later emotional distress from abandonment, which may create a higher level of misery due to feelings of loss and betrayal.

Given the emotional context and potential turmoil in Story 2, I believe it likely has a higher misery rating than Story 1.

Therefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 66. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Everyone Knows You Hate Babies. Misery Rating = 59
## Story 2: Yes Even YOU as a Bill Mitchell Can Be Hacked
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To compare the stories, I will evaluate the implications of each situation.

In Story 1, "Everyone Knows You Hate Babies," the misery rating of 59 suggests a significant emotional burden due to social ostracism or judgment, which can weigh heavily on an individual.

In Story 2, "Yes Even YOU as a Bill Mitchell Can Be Hacked," the implications of being hacked may involve feelings of vulnerability, loss of control, and potential financial or personal harm. However, this scenario seems primarily related to privacy and security rather than deep emotional suffering.

Given these assessments, I would consider the emotional impact in Story 1 to be somewhat more substantial than the potential distress from Story 2. Therefore, I believe Story 2 likely has a lower rating compared to Story 1.

My final answer is {{{lower}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 35. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Get a Public Prostate Exam
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To evaluate the story "You Get a Public Prostate Exam", I need to consider both the physical discomfort involved and the potential emotional trauma associated with such a public experience. Public examinations can lead to feelings of humiliation and anxiety, which would contribute to a higher misery rating. 

Given these factors, I estimate the misery rating to be significant but likely not in the extreme range. I will guess a rating of around 55.

Therefore, my final answer is {{{55}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 47. You were off by 8 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Snort Grandpa's ashes
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To evaluate the story "You Snort Grandpa's Ashes," I need to think about the emotional trauma and the societal perception surrounding this act. This scenario could indicate a significant degree of emotional distress, and possibly some social embarrassment or taboo associated with it. 

Given that this could lead to a high level of emotional pain, I would estimate that the misery rating might be moderate to high. If I assume the rating might be around the mid to high 60s based on potential emotional damage, I will define my interval accordingly.

If I guess a rating of 68 for this story, the interval would be:
- Lower level: 38 (68 - 30)
- Higher level: 68 (68 + 30)

Thus, my final answer would be {{{38 - 68}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Dog Loves Bones
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To evaluate the story "Your Dog Loves Bones," I need to consider the emotional context and any possible implications of this scenario. This story seems to convey a relatively light-hearted situation, likely without significant emotional trauma or physical pain. 

Given that the story appears to have a low level of misery associated with it, I would estimate a lower rating, perhaps in the 20s to 30s range. 

If I assume the rating might be around 25 for this story, the interval would be:
- Lower level: 5 (25 - 20)
- Higher level: 45 (25 + 20)

Thus, my final answer would be {{{5 - 45}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 91. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Confuse a Stick of Dynamite for a Candle
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To evaluate the story "You Confuse a Stick of Dynamite for a Candle," I need to consider the potential severity of the situation. Confusing dynamite with a candle suggests a serious level of danger, which could lead to extreme consequences, both physically (due to the risk of an explosion) and emotionally (due to the shock and fear involved).

Given the high level of potential misery associated with such a mistake, I would estimate the misery rating to be quite high. Assuming a rating around the 90s would fit the danger and consequences involved. 

If I guess a rating of 95 for this story, the interval would be:
- Lower level: 85 (95 - 10)
- Higher level: 105 (95 + 10)

Since the maximum rating is 100, I will cap the higher level to 100.

Thus, my final answer would be {{{85 - 100}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 81. Thank you for playing!
