Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.

## Story: You Destroy Kids' Art
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Let's see... based on the context, this story seems to involve a significant emotional impact, particularly for the kids whose art is destroyed. Considering that, I will estimate the misery rating to be on the higher side, perhaps around 65. 

So my final answer is {{{65}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 48. You were off by 17 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Are Addicted to Fortnite
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Based on the context of the story "You Are Addicted to Fortnite," I would estimate that the misery rating likely falls within a lower range, considering it is more about a modern-day obsession rather than severe trauma. A rating closer to the lower end might be around 40.

So, the interval I will choose is:
{{{10 - 40}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Seatmate Dries her Underwear
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: For the story "Your Seatmate Dries her Underwear," I would consider the level of embarrassment and awkwardness involved, but it doesn't seem to carry significant long-term psychological impact or severe emotional trauma. I would estimate this rating to be in a lower range, perhaps around 50.

So, the interval I will choose is:  
{{{30 - 50}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 32. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Leak Brain Fluid
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: For the story "You Leak Brain Fluid," I would consider the potential severity of this situation, as leaking brain fluid can imply serious health issues and could involve significant physical pain and long-term psychological effects. Given the seriousness of the condition, I would estimate this rating to be on the higher side, likely around 80.

So, the interval I will choose is:  
{{{70 - 80}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 64. Thank you for playing!
