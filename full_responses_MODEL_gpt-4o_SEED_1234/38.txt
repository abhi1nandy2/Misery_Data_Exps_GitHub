Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Hockey Puck Bursts Your Implant. Misery Rating = 66
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Slide into First & Feel Something Burst. Misery Rating = 43
## Story: You Get Pummeled by the Vault
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the hypothetical situations and their respective misery ratings: 

- "Hockey Puck Bursts Your Implant" with a misery rating of 66.
- "You Slide into First & Feel Something Burst" with a misery rating of 43.

We need to decide where "You Get Pummeled by the Vault" falls relative to these misery ratings.

Being pummeled by a vault could involve considerable physical pain and potential psychological trauma, which could place it at a higher misery rating. However, without more specific details, it seems reasonable to assume it would fall above "You Slide into First & Feel Something Burst" but possibly not as high as "Hockey Puck Bursts Your Implant." 

Thus, the story "You Get Pummeled by the Vault" most likely falls between these two situations.

So, my final answer is: {{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 62. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You are the goalie. After a soccer ball was saved from going into the goal you celebrated prematurely only for the ball to bounce into the goal
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To decide where the story "You are the goalie. After a soccer ball was saved from going into the goal you celebrated prematurely only for the ball to bounce into the goal" falls relative to the given misery ratings, let's consider these factors:

- "Hockey Puck Bursts Your Implant" with a misery rating of 66 involves a significant amount of physical pain and potential long-term impact.
- "You Slide into First & Feel Something Burst" with a misery rating of 43 involves physical discomfort but likely less severe than the hockey incident.

The story about the goalkeeper seems to focus more on emotional embarrassment and temporary disappointment rather than physical or long-term psychological trauma. This suggests it would likely have a lower misery rating compared to both physical injury scenarios.

Thus, my final answer is: {{{below}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 44. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Nobody Bids on Your Signed Merch at an auction put on by the Anti-Cruelty Society. Misery Rating = 44
## Story 2: You're Unknowingly the Face of an Erotic Novel
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: When comparing "Nobody Bids on Your Signed Merch at an auction put on by the Anti-Cruelty Society" (Misery Rating = 44) to "You're Unknowingly the Face of an Erotic Novel," we need to consider the potential aspects of misery involved in each situation.

- Story 1 involves embarrassment and perhaps some emotional disappointment if nobody values your contribution, but it doesn't seem to have a long-term or public impact.
- Story 2 involves a personal violation of identity and could lead to significant embarrassment and long-term discomfort, especially if it affects your personal or professional life.

Given this analysis, "You're Unknowingly the Face of an Erotic Novel" is likely to carry a greater emotional and psychological burden due to its public nature and longer-term impact.

Thus, my final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 37. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Dive Through Plate Glass. Misery Rating = 69
## Story 2: You Are Gored by a Bull
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine the relative misery rating between "You Dive Through Plate Glass" (Misery Rating = 69) and "You Are Gored by a Bull," let's examine the potential implications of each situation:

- "You Dive Through Plate Glass" involves significant physical injury, with possible severe cuts and lasting damage, contributing to both immediate physical pain and potential long-term psychological impact due to trauma or scarring.
  
- "You Are Gored by a Bull" likely involves even more severe physical trauma, given the nature of the injuries that being gored by a bull can cause. This could include life-threatening injuries, extensive recovery time, and considerable emotional and psychological impact.

Considering the severity of the physical injuries and the potential for long-term psychological effects, "You Are Gored by a Bull" likely has a higher misery rating than "You Dive Through Plate Glass."

Thus, my final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 83. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Crap Out During Your Big Interview
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To estimate the misery rating for "You Crap Out During Your Big Interview," we should consider the factors involved:

- This situation likely entails significant emotional trauma due to the embarrassment and potential career implications.
- The physical discomfort may be minor compared to the emotional impact.
- Long-term psychological effects could develop if this event affects one's confidence or professional reputation.

Given these considerations, the misery might be lower than severe physical injury stories but might still be significant due to the personal and professional implications.

The rating could be around the mid-40s to mid-50s, taking into account a balance between emotional trauma and potential long-term impact.

Therefore, an educated guess would be:

{{{48}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 60. You were off by 12 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Get Traded for Hotel Reservations
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To decide the interval for "You Get Traded for Hotel Reservations," let's assess the potential misery factors:

- Emotional impact: Being traded for something as menial as hotel reservations can lead to feelings of worthlessness and significant emotional distress.
- Long-term psychological impact: It could affect self-esteem and professional reputation.
- Physical impact is likely minimal, focusing more on emotional and psychological aspects.

Given these, the misery rating might be moderately high due to the personal devaluation, potentially aligning with stories like "Nobody Bids on Your Signed Merch," which had a rating of 44.

Considering a possible range around mid-high 40s or low 50s, I will select an interval that provides enough margin:

{{{35 - 65}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 54. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You're Tackled by a Cart
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To choose an interval for "You're Tackled by a Cart," let's evaluate the potential misery factors:

- Physical impact: Likely involves significant physical pain and possible injuries.
- Emotional impact: Could be embarrassing, especially if it happens in public, but the primary focus is on physical pain.
- Long-term psychological impact: Depends on the severity of the injuries; however, for a brief incident like this, it might be lower.

Reflecting on previous stories, such as "You Dive Through Plate Glass" with a rating of 69 and "You Slide into First & Feel Something Burst" with a rating of 43, this scenario might fall closer to typical injury-related stories but not as severe as life-threatening injuries.

Taking into account these aspects, a sensible range might be in the 50s to low 70s to account for the physical injury without being extreme.

Therefore, I'll select the interval:

{{{55 - 75}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 49. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Ice Hockey Team Can't Skate and the players fell while getting on the ice
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the appropriate interval for "Your Ice Hockey Team Can't Skate and the players fell while getting on the ice," let's break down the potential misery factors:

- Emotional impact: This situation likely leads to embarrassment and disappointment, particularly within a competitive or team setting.
- Physical impact: While there's the potential for minor physical injury from falls, the focus is more on emotional implications.
- Long-term psychological impact: Mostly limited to temporary embarrassment and potential for humorous recollection in stories, rather than severe ongoing issues.

Considering previous stories with lower misery ratings and the emphasis on embarrassment over physical harm, this scenario is likely to receive a lower rating.

Taking all these factors into account, the potential misery rating for this story might fall somewhere in the lower range. Therefore, a reasonable interval could be:

{{{30 - 40}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 25. Thank you for playing!
