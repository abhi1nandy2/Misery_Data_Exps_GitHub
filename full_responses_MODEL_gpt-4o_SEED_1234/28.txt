Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Mother-In-Law Pokes Holes in Your Condoms. Misery Rating = 62
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Gulp a Mouthful of Las Vegas Pool Party Water. Misery Rating = 33
## Story: You Destroy a Warehouse
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the situations provided, here's the reasoning:

- Destroying a warehouse seems quite serious, especially considering potential consequences such as legal issues, financial loss, employment repercussions, etc.
- Gulping pool party water, while unpleasant and potentially having short-term health issues, seems far less serious.
- Having a mother-in-law tamper with condoms is significant due to possible violations of trust and unintended consequences but is somewhat more personal than simply emotional or financial distress.

It seems likely that "You Destroy a Warehouse" has a misery rating higher than swallowing pool water but the exact impact can be less than the betrayal implied in the family-oriented situation of tampered contraception.

Therefore, it's reasonable to guess that the impact of destroying a warehouse might fall above both hypothetical situations if we assume serious implications, or potentially between them since those are quite personal and possibly more severe.

After weighing the scenarios and given the context, I will guess:

{{{above}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 64. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Your Kids Give Themselves Haircuts
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the scenarios provided, here's the reasoning:

- "Your Kids Give Themselves Haircuts" seems to have a lower misery rating as it is generally seen as a temporary and fixable situation. While it might be distressing or frustrating for parents, it's unlikely to result in long-term consequences similar to the other situations.
- Gulping Las Vegas Pool Party Water at a 33 rating involves potential short-term discomfort and health risk, but it still seems more severe than a harmless, albeit messy, haircut situation.
- The situation where a mother-in-law pokes holes in condoms is given a 62 rating, indicating a significant emotional and personal violation, which is undoubtedly more serious.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that "Your Kids Give Themselves Haircuts" falls below both of the provided situations.

My final guess is:

{{{below}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 26. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You Get Tapeworms From Sashimi. Misery Rating = 73
## Story 2: Your are suffering from a Brain Leak From Pilates
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the comparison of the two stories and their potential consequences, here's the reasoning:

- "You Get Tapeworms From Sashimi" likely involves dealing with significant health issues, including potential long-term treatment and discomfort. The misery rating of 73 suggests it is a severe and impactful experience.
- "You are suffering from a Brain Leak From Pilates" sounds extremely serious, possibly involving critical medical conditions, surgery, or permanent consequences, which would likely warrant a high misery rating.

Given the life-threatening and potentially severe nature of a brain leak compared to recovering from tapeworms, it's reasonable to suspect that Story 2 about the brain leak has a higher misery rating due to the immediate and severe health implications.

Therefore, my final answer is:

{{{higher}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Whoops! You Eat a Quart of Paint when you thought it was yogurt. Misery Rating = 36
## Story 2: You Get Hit by Bull Semen due to Semen explosion at bull insemination plant
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the comparison of the two stories and their potential consequences, here's the reasoning:

- "Whoops! You Eat a Quart of Paint when You Thought it Was Yogurt" has a misery rating of 36, which suggests a highly unpleasant but probably non-life-threatening experience, involving potential health concerns and discomfort from ingesting paint.
- "You Get Hit by Bull Semen due to Semen Explosion at Bull Insemination Plant" seems like an extremely bizarre and embarrassing situation, potentially involving a lot of emotional distress and immediate messiness, but perhaps not as concerning in terms of long-term health implications as ingesting paint.

While both stories are absurd and uncomfortable, the potential health risks and discomfort associated with eating paint might have invoked a higher misery rating. Therefore, I suspect that Story 2 might have a lower rating than eating paint due to its more immediate shock value rather than lasting consequences.

My final answer is:

{{{lower}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 49. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Get Both Nipples Pierced
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To estimate the misery rating for "You Get Both Nipples Pierced," let's consider the factors involved:

- Physical Pain: Piercing can involve significant physical pain, although it is temporary.
- Emotional Trauma: The trauma might be minimal unless unintended or unwanted.
- Long-Term Impact: There may be soreness and healing time but typically no significant long-term psychological effect.

Given these considerations and comparing it to previous situations:

- It seems less severe than dealing with tapeworms or brain leaks, which had ratings of 73 and 69, respectively.
- It might be considered more painful than the haircut scenario (26) or the quart of paint incident (36), but probably not as high as serious medical issues.
- It's plausible the rating could be a moderate reflection of temporary physical discomfort, with possibly some embarrassment factored in.

Based on this analysis, I would estimate the rating just below the halfway point given the minor long-term effects compared to emotional and temporary physical impact:

{{{45}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 38. You were off by 7 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Your Snot Drips on Live TV
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the interval for the misery rating of "Your Snot Drips on Live TV," let's consider the following factors:

- Physical Pain: There's likely no physical pain associated with this situation.
- Emotional Trauma: The embarrassment factor is high, as it happens on live TV, which can lead to significant emotional distress and humiliation.
- Long-Term Impact: While embarrassing, it is ultimately a temporary and not particularly damaging event.

Given these considerations and comparing them to prior scenarios:

- It's likely not as severe as having tapeworms (73) or experiencing a brain leak (69). 
- It could be more embarrassing than kids giving themselves haircuts (26) but less severe than eating paint (36) or being hit by bull semen (49).

This incident is primarily about emotional discomfort due to public embarrassment, which would likely push its rating above low-impact scenarios like haircuts but below more acute, health-related distress.

To fit this within the interval of 30 points, a suitable guess would be around the mid to low 40s:

{{{30 - 60}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 34. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: It's Raining Spiders on You
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the interval for the misery rating of "It's Raining Spiders on You," let's consider the following factors:

- Physical Pain: Direct physical pain might be minimal unless allergic reactions or bites are involved.
- Emotional Trauma: Significant emotional trauma could occur due to the fear of spiders (arachnophobia), a common phobia, making this a potentially terrifying experience.
- Long-Term Impact: The psychological impact might be significant for those with an intense fear of spiders, though likely not permanent.

Given these considerations and comparing it to prior scenarios:

- It’s likely more distressing than scenarios purely involving embarrassment or minor mistakes, such as snot on live TV (34).
- It might not be as severe in terms of long-term impact as more medical situations, like tapeworms (73), but could surpass the discomfort of strange mishaps like paint ingestion (36).

The rating should account for the intense emotional and psychological discomfort, especially for those with phobias, so it could lie within a moderate to higher range on the psychological distress scale.

To fit this within the interval of 20 points, a suitable guess might be in the higher spectrum of distress but not extremely high, perhaps:

{{{50 - 70}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 53. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: A Street Eats You
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the interval for the misery rating of "A Street Eats You," let's consider the following factors:

- **Physical Pain:** There could be serious physical harm involved, depending on the circumstances of being "eaten" by a street (such as falling into a sinkhole or other physically dangerous situation).
- **Emotional Trauma:** A highly traumatic and terrifying experience, likely leading to considerable immediate emotional distress.
- **Long-Term Impact:** Depending on the severity of the incident, there could be lasting psychological effects related to safety and security.

Given these considerations and comparing it to prior scenarios:

- It's likely much more severe than minor embarrassment (like snot on live TV, rated 34) or even comparably bizarre experiences (such as rain of spiders, rated 53).
- It could be on par with or even exceed the distress of severe health issues like tapeworms (73) due to the combination of physical and emotional trauma.

Considering the potential for significant physical and emotional outcomes, the misery rating would likely be on the higher end of the scale.

To fit this within the interval of 10 points, a suitable guess would be:

{{{70 - 80}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 83. Thank you for playing!
