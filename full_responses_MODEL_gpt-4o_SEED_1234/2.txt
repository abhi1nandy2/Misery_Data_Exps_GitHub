Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You're Taken Hostage During a Bank Robbery. Misery Rating = 67
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You are Stuck in Elevator Overnight with Mariah's X-Mas Song on Repeat as the Elevator Song. Misery Rating = 42
## Story: You and Mom Are Addicted to Cosmetic Surgery
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine where the story "You and Mom Are Addicted to Cosmetic Surgery" falls on the misery scale, let's consider the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

- Physical pain: Cosmetic surgery can involve significant physical discomfort and pain from the procedures and recovery. However, this is often voluntarily undertaken, which might lower the perceived level of misery compared to being taken hostage.
- Emotional trauma: The addiction to cosmetic surgery likely implies underlying emotional distress and the pressure of unrealistic beauty standards, which can be considerable.
- Long-term psychological impact: The long-term effects could be quite significant, given the compulsive nature of an addiction and its impact on self-esteem and mental health.

Comparing this to the situations:
1. Being taken hostage during a bank robbery (Rating: 67) involves intense, immediate fear and trauma, with potentially severe long-term psychological effects.
2. Being stuck in an elevator with Mariah Carey’s Christmas song on repeat (Rating: 42) is inconvenient and annoying but is relatively short-lived and less physically or emotionally harmful.

Considering these points, I would say that the misery involved in being addicted to cosmetic surgery falls between the annoyance and irritation of being stuck in an elevator and the intense trauma of being taken hostage.

Final answer: {{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 48. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Faint During Bride's Vows
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine where the story "You Faint During Bride's Vows" falls on the misery scale, let's analyze it according to the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

- Physical pain: Fainting might involve a temporary loss of consciousness and potential minor injuries from falling, but typically it doesn't involve prolonged physical pain.
- Emotional trauma: This situation could be quite embarrassing or humiliating, particularly during a significant event like a wedding. However, it is a momentary incident.
- Long-term psychological impact: The longer-term impact might be social embarrassment or regret, but it's unlikely to create lasting psychological harm beyond a funny story or mild embarrassment later on.

Comparing this to the situations:
1. Being taken hostage during a bank robbery (Rating: 67) is extremely traumatic with potential long-term psychological consequences.
2. Being stuck in an elevator with Mariah Carey’s Christmas song on repeat (Rating: 42) is an annoying but relatively harmless scenario.

Considering these factors, fainting during the bride's vows seems less severe than both being taken hostage and being stuck in an elevator all night, as it primarily involves short-lived embarrassment without substantial physical or emotional trauma.

Final answer: {{{below}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 58. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You're an Anti-gay Pastor Caught on Grindr. Misery Rating = 74
## Story 2: You Lose an Arm in Grinder
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine whether "You Lose an Arm in Grinder" has a higher or lower misery rating compared to "You're an Anti-gay Pastor Caught on Grindr," let's analyze both situations using the "Three Pillars of Misery":

- Physical pain: Losing an arm in a grinder would involve extreme physical pain and a permanently altered lifestyle, which is substantial.
- Emotional trauma: The trauma of such a severe physical injury would likely be intense, affecting one's sense of self and daily functionality.  
- Long-term psychological impact: The psychological impact would be enduring, involving adjustments to a new way of living and possible ongoing medical issues or phantom limb pain.

Compare this to the embarrassment and emotional trauma for the pastor:
- Emotional trauma: As an anti-gay pastor, being publicly caught on Grindr would cause significant emotional distress and social humiliation.
- Long-term psychological impact: The potential loss of social standing, job, and identity crisis would have serious long-term implications.

While both situations involve serious emotional trauma and long-term effects, the loss of an arm involves acute physical pain and lasting physical disability. Therefore, the misery level for losing an arm in a grinder is likely higher.

Final answer: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 96. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Contract Super-Gonorrhea. Misery Rating = 81
## Story 2: Live Tapeworm in Your Brain
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine whether "Live Tapeworm in Your Brain" has a higher or lower misery rating compared to "You Contract Super-Gonorrhea," let's analyze both situations using the "Three Pillars of Misery":

- Physical pain: Having a live tapeworm in your brain would likely result in severe physical symptoms, such as headaches, seizures, or other neurological issues, possibly requiring invasive medical treatment or surgery.
- Emotional trauma: The idea of a parasite in your brain might cause significant distress and anxiety.
- Long-term psychological impact: The potential for lasting neurological damage and the distress of the condition could lead to ongoing psychological concerns.

In comparison, contracting super-gonorrhea involves:
- Physical pain: This would likely entail significant physical discomfort and the challenges of treating a drug-resistant infection.
- Emotional trauma: There might be social stigma and anxiety about the condition and its impact on relationships.
- Long-term psychological impact: The uncertainty of treatment success and fear of complications could result in substantial long-term distress.

Both situations involve serious physical and emotional distress, but having a parasite in your brain might be perceived as far more severe due to the risk of neurological impairment and the invasive nature of potential treatments.

Final answer: {{{higher}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 73. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: Fired for Letting Kids Drive Your Bus
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine the misery rating for the story "Fired for Letting Kids Drive Your Bus," let's analyze it using the "Three Pillars of Misery":

- **Physical pain:** This scenario does not inherently involve physical pain for the individual who is fired (assuming no accident occurred).
- **Emotional trauma:** Being fired for such an incident would likely cause significant embarrassment and stress. There could also be anxiety about the media coverage or legal implications, if any.
- **Long-term psychological impact:** Losing a job, particularly if it garners public attention, can lead to financial stress, damage to one’s professional reputation, and a lasting impact on one's self-esteem and employment prospects.

Bearing in mind these factors and comparing to other situations previously rated, this situation doesn't involve direct physical harm but results in a significant emotional and professional setback. Compared to the previous stories, this might not be as severe as losing a limb or having a parasite in the brain but still quite distressing.

A reasonable estimate for the misery rating of "Fired for Letting Kids Drive Your Bus" could be a moderately high score; for example, settling towards the lower 70s.

Final guess: {{{72}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 71. You were off by 1 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Doctors Misplace Your Bladder
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the appropriate interval of ratings for the story "Doctors Misplace Your Bladder," let's evaluate it using the "Three Pillars of Misery":

- **Physical pain:** The misplaced bladder suggests a significant surgical error, likely involving substantial physical pain and possibly requiring additional surgery or medical interventions to rectify the situation.
- **Emotional trauma:** The idea of a medical mistake of this magnitude could cause extreme distress, loss of trust in medical professionals, and anxiety about future procedures or health implications.
- **Long-term psychological impact:** This could have lasting consequences on one's health, necessitating ongoing treatment, financial burden, and enduring psychological trauma due to the experience of being the victim of a serious medical error.

Considering these implications, such an incident would likely be rated quite high on the misery scale due to the physical harm and psychological impact. Stories involving medical negligence often have high ratings given their severity and potential for lasting effects.

Given the nature of this incident, a reasonable rating might fall in a relatively high range. With an interval size of 30 points, and considering the severity, I would estimate the narrative's misery rating interval could begin in the upper-middle to high section of the scale.

Final interval guess: {{{70-100}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 64. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Pop Rocks in Your Vagina
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the appropriate interval of ratings for the story "Pop Rocks in Your Vagina," let's evaluate it using the "Three Pillars of Misery":

- **Physical pain:** The discomfort involved in such an experience could be intense, depending on the reaction of the candy in a sensitive area. However, it might not equate with long-term physical harm.
- **Emotional trauma:** There could be embarrassment and distress associated with explaining the situation to medical professionals, as well as personal discomfort.
- **Long-term psychological impact:** The psychological effects are likely short-lived, although there might be some lasting embarrassment or anxiety about similar incidents in the future.

Given that this scenario involves temporary physical discomfort and embarrassment but lacks the long-term impact of more serious medical errors, the rating might fall in the lower or middle range of the scale.

With an interval size of 20 points, and considering the relatively lower severity compared to major medical errors, a reasonable interval might be towards the middle to lower sections of the scale.

Final interval guess: {{{45-65}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 40. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Butt Dial Your Victim
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the appropriate interval of ratings for the story "You Butt Dial Your Victim," let's evaluate it using the "Three Pillars of Misery":

- **Physical pain:** This situation does not involve physical pain.
- **Emotional trauma:** The emotional distress could be significant due to the embarrassment or unintended consequences of butt dialing someone you're trying to avoid or have wronged. There might be anxiety about the conversation that was overheard and its implications.
- **Long-term psychological impact:** The impact here may range from moderate embarrassment to potential social or professional fallout, particularly if the call revealed sensitive or damaging information.

Considering that this scenario is embarrassing and potentially damaging but not severe in terms of physical harm or long-lasting trauma, it is likely rated relatively low on the misery scale.

With an interval size of 10 points and the relatively low severity of the incident, the rating is likely on the lower end of the scale.

Final interval guess: {{{30-40}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 52. Thank you for playing!
