Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Hairdresser Sneezes and Gives You Bangs. Misery Rating = 44
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Your Child Joins an A Cappella Group. Misery Rating = 20
## Story: A Woman Gives Birth In Your Cab
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story about a woman giving birth in your cab likely involves a significant amount of stress and potential chaos, but it might not reach the level of personal or emotional catastrophe implied by the situations rated at 44 or 20. However, I would estimate that this situation is more inconvenient and stress-inducing than the hypothetical Situation 2 but does not surpass the stress of an accidental haircut. Therefore, I would guess this story falls between the two hypothetical situations.

 {{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 33. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Faint During Your Friend's Wedding
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Fainting during a friend's wedding could be quite embarrassing and cause some emotional stress, but it doesn't seem to carry the same level of prolonged emotional trauma or inconvenience as having a significant haircut mistake or even having a child join an unexpected hobby. Fainting is typically a fleeting event and would likely be remembered but eventually laughed off, so it might be less impactful than a haircut blunder that lingers or the day-to-day adjustments involved with a child in an a cappella group.

I would estimate that the rating for fainting at a friend's wedding falls above the inconvenience of having a child join an a cappella group but below the stress of an accidental bangs haircut.

{{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 32. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Home is Trashed in a Drug-Fueled Orgy. Misery Rating = 73
## Story 2: Your Anger Management Classmate Stabs You
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Having a classmate from anger management stab you is likely to be assessed with a significant level of physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact. On the other hand, while having your home trashed in a drug-fueled orgy would certainly cause distress and financial troubles, physical harm and personal safety are more critical issues in the stabbing incident. Thus, I would expect Story 2 to have a higher misery rating compared to Story 1.

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 78. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You are caught after Falling Asleep During Sex in Public in a university hallway. Misery Rating = 52
## Story 2: Dad Steals Your Girl Scout Cookie Money for an Erotic Massage
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Story 2, where your dad steals your Girl Scout cookie money for an erotic massage, is more likely to generate a high degree of emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological impact due to the betrayal and breach of trust by a parental figure. In contrast, while being caught sleeping during sex in public is certainly embarrassing, it lacks the same personal betrayal aspect and might be considered less severe in terms of long-term psychological effects. Therefore, I would expect Story 2 to have a higher misery rating compared to Story 1.

{{{higher}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 50. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: A Creepy Stranger Watches You Workout
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Experiencing a creepy stranger watching you while you workout is indeed unsettling, involving emotional discomfort and potential ongoing anxiety, especially regarding personal safety. However, it might not be as severe as situations involving physical harm or extreme betrayal. Considering all factors of discomfort and worry about personal boundaries and how it would play out in daily scenarios, I would estimate this might fall within a mid-range rating of misery. 

{{{45}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 21. You were off by 24 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Get Bitten by a Snake While Sleeping
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Snake bites can be frightening and potentially dangerous, involving both physical pain and fear of long-term medical issues. However, without more context about the severity or type of snake, this might not score extremely high given it's hypothetical and not life-threatening at first glance. I would estimate a broader middle range for this rating.

{{{40 - 70}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 70. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Car is Dragged for Miles
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Having your car dragged for miles could potentially result in significant financial loss and inconvenience, along with a moderate level of emotional stress, depending on whether anyone was inside or injured. The absence of immediate physical harm to a person might lower the Index rating, but the broader impact on one's sense of security and stability might still place it relatively high on the scale.

Given these considerations, a sensible rating might fall in the higher middle range, accounting for the substantial property damage and stress involved.

{{{55 - 75}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 57. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You are a doctor who Sucks Out a Passenger's Urine for 37 Minutes Mid-Flight to save his life
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Being in a situation where you're compelled to perform an unconventional medical procedure, such as sucking out a passenger's urine mid-flight, likely involves an intense level of discomfort, pressure, and emotional distress, not to mention the social implications afterward. While the act is heroic and life-saving, the immediate experience would mark a significant moment of professional and personal challenge, likely scoring high due to the physical ick factor and emotional strain involved.

Considering the intensity of emotions and the peculiar nature of the situation, I would estimate the rating to fall on the higher side but not quite at the maximum, given the life-saving aspect provides some sense of positive outcome.

{{{80 - 90}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 56. Thank you for playing!
