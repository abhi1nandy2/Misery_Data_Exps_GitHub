Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You're Stuck Behind a Garbage Truck for 15 Miles. Misery Rating = 32
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Call Your Boss Mommy During All-Staff Meeting. Misery Rating = 50
## Story: You jumped onto a trampoline and then crashed into the Side of a Pool missing the water
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine where the story falls:

- The first hypothetical situation (stuck behind a garbage truck) has a misery rating of 32.
- The second hypothetical situation (calling your boss "mommy") has a misery rating of 50.

The story involves jumping onto a trampoline and crashing into the side of a pool. This incident likely involves significant physical pain and possibly emotional embarrassment, which may result in a higher rating than being called "mommy" by your boss, but it still might not be as impactful as situations with long-term effects. 

Considering these factors, it's likely that the rating of the trampoline incident falls above 50. Therefore, the final answer is:

{{{above}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 67. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Kid Crawls into Your Bathroom Stall
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine where the story falls:

- The first hypothetical situation (stuck behind a garbage truck) has a misery rating of 32.
- The second hypothetical situation (calling your boss "mommy") has a misery rating of 50.

The story involves a kid crawling into your bathroom stall. This situation can be awkward and embarrassing, but it likely involves less physical pain and long-term psychological impact compared to the previous story and the "mommy" incident.

Considering these factors, it's likely that the rating for a kid crawling into your bathroom stall falls somewhere between the ratings of 32 and 50. Therefore, the final answer is:

{{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 38. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Knee Is Crushed by the Knee Splitter. Misery Rating = 91
## Story 2: Your Groin is Split by the Wooden Horse
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine whether Story 2 has a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1:

- Story 1 involves a knee being crushed by the knee splitter, which has a high misery rating of 91. This suggests severe physical pain and potentially long-term psychological impact.
- Story 2 involves the groin being split by the wooden horse, which also suggests immense physical pain, possibly even higher due to the sensitivity of the area and potential for long-term consequences.

Given the severity of physical pain and possible long-term trauma associated with the groin injury, it's plausible that Story 2 could have an even higher rating than Story 1.

Therefore, my final answer is:

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 95. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Spend a Day Wearing the Shame Flute. Misery Rating = 62
## Story 2: You Spend a Day in the Scold's Bridle that includes an iron mask with a metal tongue depressor
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine whether Story 2 has a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1:

- Story 1 involves spending a day wearing the Shame Flute, which has a misery rating of 62. This suggests significant emotional embarrassment and discomfort.
- Story 2 involves spending a day in the Scold's Bridle with an iron mask and metal tongue depressor. This likely involves not only emotional discomfort and embarrassment but also physical discomfort and potential pain.

Given the additional element of physical discomfort and the severity associated with the Scold's Bridle, it's reasonable to expect Story 2 to have a higher rating compared to Story 1.

Therefore, my final answer is:

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 77. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Get Dragged by a Horse
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine the misery rating for the story:

- The story involves being dragged by a horse, which implies a combination of significant physical pain due to the dragging itself, potential for severe injuries, and possible long-term psychological impact. Such an experience is likely to be very traumatic.

Considering these factors, I would estimate that the misery rating is quite high, but not necessarily as high as some of the extremely severe physical injuries or tortures.

Therefore, my estimated misery rating is:

{{{82}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 47. You were off by 35 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Your Stretcher Tips Over
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: You need to guess the misery rating of the story "Your Stretcher Tips Over" within a 30-point interval. Considering this scenario:

- The incident likely involves a sudden and potentially startling experience, with moderate physical discomfort or embarrassment.
- It's not likely to be as painful or traumatic as some of the more severe stories we've seen.

Given this, a reasonable estimation might be somewhere in the lower half of the scale. To choose the 30-point range that covers the potential rating:

{{{35 - 65}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 61. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: No One Comes to Your Loneliness Seminar
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the misery rating for the story "No One Comes to Your Loneliness Seminar":

- This situation involves a significant emotional impact related to feelings of rejection and embarrassment.
- However, it lacks the physical pain or long-term physical consequences seen in some other stories.

Given the emphasis on emotional trauma without severe physical pain, it's likely that the misery rating falls in a moderate range. To choose a 20-point interval that covers the potential rating:

{{{40 - 60}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 41. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: A Toaster Toasts You
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the misery rating for the story "A Toaster Toasts You":

- This scenario likely involves some degree of physical pain due to burns from the toaster, but it may not carry the same level of emotional trauma or long-term psychological impact as more severe incidents.
- Considering the likely severity of the burns and assuming they are not life-threatening, the rating might fall on the lower to moderate end of the scale.

Given these factors and needing to guess within a 10-point interval, I would choose a range toward the lower end, but mindful of significant discomfort.

My final answer is:

{{{25 - 35}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 62. Thank you for playing!
