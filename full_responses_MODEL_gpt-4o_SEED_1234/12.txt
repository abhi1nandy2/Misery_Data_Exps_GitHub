Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.

Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Accidentally CC the Person You're S**t-Talking. Misery Rating = 56
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Stuck in Jail Overnight With Your Ex. Misery Rating = 38
## Story: You Drop a Baby
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the hypothetical situations and their respective misery ratings: 

- "Accidentally CC the Person You're S**t-Talking" has a misery rating of 56.
- "Stuck in Jail Overnight With Your Ex" has a misery rating of 38.

The story "You Drop a Baby" likely involves significant emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological impact, which could place its misery rating higher than both hypothetical situations. 

Therefore, my final answer is {{{above}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 41. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Get Hit by a sports Car
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the hypothetical situations and their respective misery ratings:

- "Accidentally CC the Person You're S**t-Talking" has a misery rating of 56.
- "Stuck in Jail Overnight With Your Ex" has a misery rating of 38.

The story "You Get Hit by a Sports Car" likely involves significant physical pain and emotional trauma, which could place its misery rating above both hypothetical situations. 

Therefore, my final answer is {{{above}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 60. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You Catch Your Wife Cheating on Google Street View. Misery Rating = 68
## Story 2: You Drive an SUV Off a Cliff
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Considering the nature of both stories:

- "You Catch Your Wife Cheating on Google Street View" has a misery rating of 68 and involves considerable emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological impact.
- "You Drive an SUV Off a Cliff" likely involves significant physical pain and possibly emotional trauma.

Given that driving off a cliff could result in severe physical injury or worse, its misery rating could potentially be higher than the emotional trauma of the first story.

Therefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 83. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Accidentally Trigger a false Incoming Missile Alert. Misery Rating = 61
## Story 2: You wrongly hear Your Plane is Crashing
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Considering the nature of both stories:

- "You Accidentally Trigger a False Incoming Missile Alert" has a misery rating of 61 and involves significant emotional trauma and potentially long-term psychological impact, especially due to the panic and fear it could cause.
- "You Wrongly Hear Your Plane is Crashing" would involve immense emotional trauma and fear, likely leading to a heightened state of panic.

Since the fear and potential life-threatening implication from wrongly hearing that your plane is crashing could be extremely traumatizing, it is likely that Story 2 has a higher misery rating than Story 1.

Therefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 64. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Pee Your Pants in Public
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Considering the nature of the story "You Pee Your Pants in Public," it primarily involves emotional trauma due to embarrassment and social stigma. While it can be quite distressing, it may not have as severe long-term psychological impacts as some other stories, though it certainly would be a significant moment of humiliation.

Given these considerations, I would estimate a mid-range misery rating, as it is more severe than minor embarrassments but not as impactful as stories involving physical harm or extreme psychological damage.

Therefore, my final answer is {{{50}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 34. You were off by 16 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: A Python Comes Out of Your Bathroom
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Considering the story "A Python Comes Out of Your Bathroom," the situation likely involves significant emotional trauma due to fear and potential physical danger. While this is a terrifying experience, it may not have as lasting a psychological impact as life-threatening or extremely traumatic events but is still quite distressing.

Given the factors involved, a reasonable estimate might be somewhere on the higher end of the scale, but not extremely high unless there is actual injury involved.

Therefore, my final answer will be within the range of {{{55 - 85}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 39. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Toddler is Trapped Inside a Skee-Ball Machine
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Considering the story "Your Toddler is Trapped Inside a Skee-Ball Machine," there is undoubtedly significant emotional trauma involved, especially due to the panic and fear for the child's safety. However, this situation likely resolves quickly without long-term psychological impact, assuming the toddler is unharmed. 

Given these considerations, the misery rating may be moderate, reflecting the initial fear but considering the potential for quick resolution without severe consequences.

Therefore, my final answer will be within the range of {{{40 - 60}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 46. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Bleeding occurred in ears & noses because Your Flight Crew Forgets to Pressurize the Plane
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Considering the story "Bleeding occurred in ears & noses because Your Flight Crew Forgets to Pressurize the Plane," this situation involves significant physical pain and potential health risks due to the lack of cabin pressure. Furthermore, there is likely substantial emotional trauma due to the terrifying nature of the situation, compounded by the incompetence of the flight crew.

Given the severity of the physical symptoms and the distressing nature of the incident, the misery rating is likely on the higher end of the scale. Accounting for the narrow margin allowed in this round, my estimated range is towards the top but just under severe trauma situations.

Therefore, my final answer will be within the range of {{{70 - 80}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 74. Thank you for playing!
