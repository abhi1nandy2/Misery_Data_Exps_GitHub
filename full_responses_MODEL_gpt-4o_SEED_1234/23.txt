Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Glass Thermometer Shatters in Your Mouth. Misery Rating = 58
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Your Feet Appear on a Fetish Website. Misery Rating = 30
## Story: A Snake Bites Your Face
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the two hypothetical situations:

1. Glass Thermometer Shatters in Your Mouth with a Misery Rating = 58
2. Your Feet Appear on a Fetish Website with a Misery Rating = 30

The story in question is "A Snake Bites Your Face."

Considering the physical pain, emotional trauma, and possible long-term psychological impact associated with a snake bite to the face, it's likely this situation has a high misery rating. 

Therefore, "A Snake Bites Your Face" likely falls above 58. 

My final answer is {{{above}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 62. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Pass Out on Live TV
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Considering the two hypothetical situations:

1. Glass Thermometer Shatters in Your Mouth with a Misery Rating = 58
2. Your Feet Appear on a Fetish Website with a Misery Rating = 30

The story in question is "You Pass Out on Live TV."

While passing out on live TV could be embarrassing and emotionally traumatic, it likely doesn't involve as much physical pain or long-term psychological impact as having a glass thermometer shatter in your mouth. It's also more significant than the discomfort of your feet appearing on a fetish site.

Therefore, "You Pass Out on Live TV" likely falls between 30 and 58.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 44. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You are a patient with bizarre form of amnesia and you feel like you are still in 2005 after a routine dental treatment. Misery Rating = 83
## Story 2: You're Trapped in a Coma for 12 Years
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: When evaluating the two stories, we have:

1. **Story 1:** You are a patient with a bizarre form of amnesia and feel like you are still in 2005 after a routine dental treatment, with a misery rating of 83.
2. **Story 2:** You're trapped in a coma for 12 years.

Being trapped in a coma for 12 years likely includes significant physical, emotional, and psychological misery. The long duration and potential isolation and helplessness could contribute to an extremely high misery rating.

Given these considerations, it seems very likely that being trapped in a coma for 12 years would have a higher misery rating than the amnesia scenario.

Therefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 85. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You're Addicted to Cat Fur. Misery Rating = 57
## Story 2: An Octopus is Stuck on Your Face
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: When evaluating the two stories, we have:

1. **Story 1:** You're addicted to cat fur, with a misery rating of 57.
2. **Story 2:** An octopus is stuck on your face.

Having an octopus stuck on your face could involve physical discomfort and fear due to the surprise and potential difficulty in removing it, but may not carry the same long-term psychological impact as being addicted to cat fur, which could affect one's daily life.

However, considering the immediate physical discomfort and emotional trauma from an octopus being stuck to your face, it might be rated higher than the addiction scenario.

Therefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 49. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You're Forced to Go Skydiving
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: When considering the story "You're Forced to Go Skydiving," we need to account for the varying aspects of the Three Pillars of Misery: physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

- **Physical Pain:** Skydiving itself is unlikely to cause pain unless there is an accident, but there's a potential for discomfort.
- **Emotional Trauma:** The act of being forced to go skydiving could be highly stressful and frightening, especially if the person has a fear of heights or flying.
- **Long-term Psychological Impact:** There could be lasting anxiety or trauma if the experience is particularly terrifying, but this will vary greatly with individual circumstances.

Skydiving can be quite intimidating and frightening for many people, which suggests a moderate level of misery. However, it might not reach the extremes of stories involving significant physical harm or long-term psychological effects.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable guess would place the misery rating at a moderate level. My final answer is {{{65}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 35. You were off by 30 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You are a woman who has 44 Kids by age 36
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: When evaluating the story "You are a woman who has 44 Kids by age 36," we need to consider the potential physical, emotional, and long-term psychological impacts:

- **Physical Impact:** Having a large number of children within a relatively short time span could have considerable physical stress and impact on one's health.
- **Emotional Trauma:** Managing such a large family could lead to significant emotional exhaustion and stress.
- **Long-term Psychological Impact:** The ongoing responsibility and pressure could have far-reaching psychological effects.

Given these factors, this is likely to have a high misery rating due to the intense physical and emotional demands. However, without specific knowledge of the exact rating, an estimate within a 30-point range can be challenging, but a relatively high range might be appropriate.

My final answer is to estimate a range like {{{70-100}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 74. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Bus Breaks in Half at the middle while you are standing in the back
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: When considering the story "Your Bus Breaks in Half at the middle while you are standing in the back," we should assess the potential aspects of misery:

- **Physical Pain:** There is potential for injury, depending on the severity of the incident.
- **Emotional Trauma:** The shock and fear associated with a bus breaking apart around you could be significant.
- **Long-term Psychological Impact:** Likely to involve some stress and anxiety related to traveling by bus in the future, but may not be extreme if no lasting injuries occur.

This scenario could induce a moderate to high level of misery due to the immediate danger and fear. However, without severe long-term effects, it likely doesn't reach the highest misery ratings. Given a narrower margin of 20 points, I'll estimate a moderate to relatively high range.

My final answer is {{{50-70}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 45. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Have a Fork in Your Penis that is surgically removed
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: When evaluating the story "You Have a Fork in Your Penis that is surgically removed," we need to consider the potential aspects of misery:

- **Physical Pain:** This scenario likely involves significant physical pain both from the presence of the fork and the surgical removal.
- **Emotional Trauma:** There is potential for substantial emotional distress and embarrassment related to the situation.
- **Long-term Psychological Impact:** The experience could lead to lasting psychological trauma or anxiety surrounding medical procedures or intimate situations.

Given these factors, this situation is likely to have a very high misery rating due to the severe physical and emotional aspects involved. Considering the narrow margin of 10 points for this estimation, I would aim for a high range.

My final answer is {{{80-90}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 80. Thank you for playing!
