Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Are Mistakenly Deported. Misery Rating = 81
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Find Your Grandpa's Diary; Discover He Was a Nazi. Misery Rating = 43
## Story: There's a Live Leech up Your Nose
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The misery of having a live leech up your nose likely entails significant physical discomfort and emotional distress, but it may not have as long-lasting of a psychological impact as being mistakenly deported or discovering a dark family secret like finding out your grandpa was a Nazi. Given this, it's reasonable to assume that the misery level is somewhere in between these two situations.

Therefore, the final answer is: {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 58. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You're a Principal who hired a pole dancer to welcome kindergartners to school
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: This scenario entails a significant amount of potential embarrassment and professional repercussions, but likely doesn't involve as severe physical pain or emotional trauma as the prior two hypothetical situations. Hiring a pole dancer for kindergartners is extremely inappropriate, leading to social and professional fallout, but it doesn't rise to the level of personal upheaval or betrayal involved in being mistakenly deported or discovering a grandparent's dark history.

Therefore, the final answer is: {{{below}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 63. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You Meet a Friendly Masturbator. Misery Rating = 38
## Story 2: You Almost Get Carjacked by a Naked Man
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Encountering an attempted carjacking by a naked man likely involves a significant level of fear, threat to personal safety, and potential for trauma, compared to the awkwardness and discomfort associated with meeting a friendly masturbator. The physical and emotional distress from a near carjacking experience would contribute to a higher misery rating.

Therefore, the final answer is: {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 45. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Accidentally Sext Your Dad. Misery Rating = 50
## Story 2: Your Dad Accidentally Sexts You
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The situation where your dad accidentally sexts you likely involves a higher level of emotional discomfort and psychological impact compared to accidentally sexting your dad. The sense of unexpected invasion and discomfort from receiving such a message from a parent may be perceived as more distressing.

Therefore, the final answer is: {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 61. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Suck a Lady's Dirty Foot
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Asking someone to suck a lady's dirty foot is an unpleasant scenario that likely involves significant emotional distress due to the disgust and embarrassment associated with such an action, as well as a potential blow to personal dignity. However, it might not have the same level of long-term psychological impact as some of the other scenarios we've discussed. Given the balance of these factors, a reasonable estimate for the misery rating of this story could be around 55.

Therefore, the final answer is: {{{55}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 45. You were off by 10 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You found a dead mouse inside your can of Red Bull after taking a sip and feeling something hit your lip.
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Finding a dead mouse in a can of Red Bull after taking a sip is likely a highly distressing experience involving physical disgust and potential health concerns, along with emotional trauma from the shock. The overall experience can have significant psychological impact, particularly due to the fear of contamination and the unexpected nature of the event. Given these considerations, we can estimate that the misery rating might be moderate to high.

Therefore, the final interval answer is: {{{60 - 90}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 65. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Eat 2 Lbs of Your Own Hair which is then removed from your stomach by doctors
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Eating 2 lbs of your own hair and then having it removed from your stomach by doctors is an extreme scenario that involves both physical pain and significant emotional distress. The physical discomfort and potential medical complications add to the misery, while the emotional trauma from the situation could contribute to a long-lasting psychological impact. Considering these factors, this situation likely has a high misery rating.

Therefore, the final interval answer is: {{{70 - 90}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 71. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Have One Happy Day in 129 Years
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Having only one happy day in 129 years is an incredibly miserable scenario characterized by a profound and enduring sense of unhappiness and emotional pain. The lack of joy over such an extended period suggests significant long-term psychological impact, likely resulting in an extremely high misery rating. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate that the misery rating would be very close to the upper bound of the scale.

Therefore, the final interval answer is: {{{90 - 100}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 45. Thank you for playing!
