Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Send a Nude Selfie to HR by mistake. Misery Rating = 70
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You find Maggots in your Fried Rice. Misery Rating = 45
## Story: You are Attacked by a bear after Reasoning with the bear
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story of being attacked by a bear after reasoning with it likely involves significant physical pain and emotional trauma, potentially leading to a high long-term psychological impact. Given that the Situations have ratings of 70 and 45, I would expect this bear attack story to have a higher misery rating than both. 

My final answer is: {{{above}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 52. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Left your Mic On and Went Toilet
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Leaving your mic on while going to the toilet could be quite embarrassing and involves emotional trauma, but it doesn't involve physical pain or a severe long-term psychological impact. In comparison with the hypothetical situations provided — sending a nude selfie to HR (rating 70) and finding maggots in your fried rice (rating 45) — this situation might be considered less miserable than sending a nude selfie to HR but more miserable than finding maggots in your fried rice. 

Therefore, I would place this story between the two situations.

My final answer is: {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 49. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You go to a doctor. Doctor Borrows $300k from you and  then diagnoses you with Dementia. Misery Rating = 76
## Story 2: You are Fired After Donating Kidney to help your Boss
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Being fired after donating a kidney to help your boss is an extremely distressing situation. It involves betrayal, significant emotional trauma, and could have a profound long-term psychological impact. While the first story of a doctor borrowing a significant amount of money and then diagnosing you with dementia is also incredibly distressing, the betrayal experienced in Story 2 seems even more severe. Therefore, Story 2 could potentially have a higher misery rating.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You are breastfed until you are 9. Misery Rating = 63
## Story 2: You as a Teen are forced by your parents to Live in Woods for eating a pop-tart
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Experiencing forced exile into the woods as a teenager due to a seemingly minor infraction like eating a pop-tart would likely involve significant emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological impact. Being breastfed until age 9 might be socially awkward and potentially embarrassing, but it might not carry the same level of immediate distress or emotional intensity. Given these considerations, I would expect Story 2 to have a higher misery rating than Story 1.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 69. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You offend a room of feminist panelists
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Offending a room of feminist panelists can result in significant social embarrassment and potential emotional trauma. However, it may not involve physical pain or severe long-term psychological impact. Given the various levels of misery we've seen so far, I would estimate this situation to have a moderate misery rating.

My final guess for the rating of this story is: {{{55}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 47. You were off by 8 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You discover your wife cheating in your Uber
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Discovering your wife cheating while in an Uber could involve significant emotional trauma and have a considerable long-term psychological impact. Given these factors and keeping in mind the rating scale, I would expect the misery rating to be relatively high.

I will choose a range that reflects these considerations. Considering our previous ratings:

My final answer is: {{{60 - 90}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 76. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You are in an Escalator which Speeds Up
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Being on an escalator that suddenly speeds up can be startling and potentially dangerous, but it might not result in severe physical injury or long-lasting emotional trauma. Based on this assessment and previous story ratings, this situation seems less severe.

I would estimate the misery rating to fall on the lower end of the scale.

My final answer is: {{{30 - 50}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 32. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your testicles get stuck in the shower stool
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Getting your testicles stuck in a shower stool could be extremely painful and distressing, impacting both physical pain and emotional trauma aspects of the misery rating. It might not have a significant long-term psychological impact but is likely higher on the scale due to the immediate physical and emotional distress.

Given that we are looking at a smaller interval, I will choose a range reflecting a higher level of immediate misery:

My final answer is: {{{70 - 80}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 49. Thank you for playing!
