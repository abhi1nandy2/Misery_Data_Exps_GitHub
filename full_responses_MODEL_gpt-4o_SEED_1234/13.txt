Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.

Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Ruptured Your Bladder Jumping a Fence. Misery Rating = 80
## Hypothetical Situation 2: See Your Dad in a Vintage Porno. Misery Rating = 55
## Story: You Get Run Over by a Boat
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the two hypothetical situations, Ruptured Your Bladder Jumping a Fence has a misery rating of 80 and See Your Dad in a Vintage Porno has a misery rating of 55. The story You Get Run Over by a Boat likely involves significant physical pain and potential emotional trauma, which could suggest a relatively high misery rating. However, without additional details, it seems plausible that this situation might fall between the two ratings provided, taking into account the long-term psychological impact and severe physical pain. Therefore, my final answer is:

{{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Flash Everyone at Your Wedding
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You Flash Everyone at Your Wedding" likely involves significant embarrassment and potential emotional trauma, but it doesn't seem to have severe physical pain or long-term psychological impact similar to the other situations. Compared to "Ruptured Your Bladder Jumping a Fence" with a rating of 80 and "See Your Dad in a Vintage Porno" with a rating of 55, this situation seems like it would have a lower overall misery rating. Considering these factors, my final answer is:

{{{below}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 59. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: A Potato Is Growing in Your Vagina. Misery Rating = 60
## Story 2: A Python Bites Your Penis while you are sitting on a toilet
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given Story 1, "A Potato Is Growing in Your Vagina," has a misery rating of 60, it involves significant embarrassment and possibly some physical discomfort.

Story 2, "A Python Bites Your Penis while you are sitting on a toilet," seems to involve more immediate and severe physical pain, significant shock, and potential long-term psychological impact.

Considering these factors, Story 2 likely has a higher misery rating than Story 1. Therefore, my final answer is:

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 83. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Your Car is Kangarooed. Misery Rating = 38
## Story 2: A Cow Kicks Your Ass
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The phrase "Your Car is Kangarooed" has a misery rating of 38 and seems to indicate damage or inconvenience related to a car incident involving a kangaroo, which might be annoying or financially frustrating but not physically harmful.

Story 2, "A Cow Kicks Your Ass," suggests an event that may involve physical pain and potential embarrassment. Considering the possibility of physical injury and shock, Story 2 might have a higher misery rating than Story 1.

Taking these factors into account, my final answer is:

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 56. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Lose Your Eyebrows
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Losing your eyebrows can be a distressing experience, primarily due to the emotional impact and possible social embarrassment. However, it does not involve significant physical pain or a considerable long-term psychological impact compared to many other situations. Given that, I would estimate a moderately low misery rating.

Taking these factors into account, my final answer is:

{{{40}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 36. You were off by 4 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Poop so Hard You Forget a Decade
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Losing a decade of memories due to such an extreme physical event can be deeply unsettling, involving significant physical strain and emotional trauma. Given this context, it's likely to have a high misery rating. However, the humor and absurdity might take away some severity for some people. Here's how I would reasonably guess:

Considering the range possibilities, I would guess within a 30-point range around a moderately high rating.

Taking these factors into account, my final answer is:

{{{60 - 90}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 63. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: A Cliff Falls on You
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Being caught in an event where a cliff falls on you involves extreme physical danger and likely severe injuries, along with significant emotional trauma and potentially long-term psychological impact. It seems logical to assume this situation would have a very high misery rating due to the severity and life-threatening nature of the event. Here's my guess for a 20-point range:

Considering these factors, my final answer is:

{{{80 - 100}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 81. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Dentures are Lodged In Your Throat eight days after surgery
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Having dentures lodged in your throat for eight days after surgery suggests significant physical discomfort and potential danger. There's likely a mix of physical pain, ongoing difficulty breathing or swallowing, and considerable emotional stress. This situation involves more immediate physiological distress and anxiety. Given the serious nature of this scenario, I would estimate a high misery rating.

Here's my guess for a 10-point range:

{{{70 - 80}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 61. Thank you for playing!
