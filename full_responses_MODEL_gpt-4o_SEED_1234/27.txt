Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You're Bonked on the Head and Forget How to Read. Misery Rating = 81
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Sister-in-Law Pulls You into a Pyramid Scheme. Misery Rating = 36
## Story: You're Crushed by Broken Glass
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Considering the two hypothetical situations given:

- Being bonked on the head and forgetting how to read has a high misery rating of 81, indicating significant long-term psychological impact and potential daily life disruption.
- Being pulled into a pyramid scheme by a sister-in-law has a lower misery rating of 36, suggesting moderate to low emotional trauma and psychological impact.

The story "You're Crushed by Broken Glass" likely involves physical pain and potential long-term psychological impact due to injury and trauma. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that this situation would have a higher misery rating than getting involved in a pyramid scheme but potentially not as high as losing the ability to read.

Therefore, the misery rating of being crushed by broken glass likely falls between these two scenarios.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 95. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You ate cat vomit on TV and thought it was Grape-Nuts
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Eating cat vomit on TV while believing it's Grape-Nuts involves significant embarrassment and gross-out factor, creating high emotional trauma but likely limited long-term psychological impact compared to the other stories.

- The misery rating for being bonked on the head and forgetting how to read is 81, implying severe impact.
- Being pulled into a pyramid scheme by a sister-in-law is rated at 36, indicating moderate to low impact.

Given the nature of the story, eating cat vomit on TV might likely evoke strong feelings of humiliation and disgust but doesn't compare to long-term suffering like losing an ability or the deep betrayal of a pyramid scheme.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 32. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You went to jail for Masturbating in Horse Fields. Misery Rating = 64
## Story 2: You're a Priest Who Gets Caught Having Sex With a Nun
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Both stories involve public scandal and potential legal repercussions, but let's break them down:

- Story 1: "You went to jail for Masturbating in Horse Fields" has a misery rating of 64. This story involves public humiliation, legal trouble, and possibly some long-term stigma.

- Story 2: "You're a Priest Who Gets Caught Having Sex With a Nun" involves significant public and personal scandal, as well as a direct violation of religious vows, which could lead to severe personal and professional repercussions. This might involve both emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact due to the religious and ethical breach, making it potentially more miserable.

Given the severity and multi-layered nature of Story 2, it is likely to have a higher misery rating compared to Story 1.

My final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 76. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Your Seat Mate's Leg Oozes Pus. Misery Rating = 38
## Story 2: You Hit the Ceiling During Extreme Turbulence
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Let's analyze the situations for Story 1 and Story 2:

- Story 1: "Your Seat Mate's Leg Oozes Pus" has a misery rating of 38. It involves discomfort and disgust due to proximity to a medical issue, which is unpleasant but mostly temporary and not life-threatening.

- Story 2: "You Hit the Ceiling During Extreme Turbulence" involves a sudden and potentially dangerous experience. This situation might entail significant physical injury and emotional trauma from the fear of a catastrophic event. The immediate danger and potential for physical harm could likely elevate the misery index.

Given the potential for injury and the intense fear associated with extreme turbulence, Story 2 is likely to have a higher misery rating compared to Story 1.

My final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 51. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: Your Lyft Driver is a Nightmare
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Let's evaluate the potential misery index for the story "Your Lyft Driver is a Nightmare."

Several factors could contribute to the misery of this situation:

1. **Physical Pain**: Generally minimal unless a serious driving incident occurs.
2. **Emotional Trauma**: The experience could involve distress, discomfort, fear for personal safety, or worry about reaching your destination on time.
3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: Usually not severe, unless the event was particularly traumatic or invoked a sense of danger.

Considering these aspects, the overall misery is more tied to emotional disturbance and discomfort rather than long-term impacts. Such a situation might rate lower compared to stories involving physical harm or significant life disruptions.

Estimating the misery rating, it might fall around the mid-range given the inconvenience and stress but lack of severe long-term effects.

My final answer is {{{45}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 19. You were off by 26 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Your Husband Has the World's Longest Ear Hair
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Let's consider the story "Your Husband Has the World's Longest Ear Hair."

This situation likely involves a level of embarrassment or minor social discomfort, but it probably doesn't lead to significant emotional trauma or any long-term psychological impact. The incident may be more humorous than distressing.

Given the likely light-hearted nature of the situation, the misery rating is expected to be quite low compared to more severe or distressing stories.

Therefore, the interval probably should start from a lower end of the scale. A reasonable guess for the interval might be 1 to 31.

My final answer is {{{1 - 31}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 28. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Shoot Yourself With a Nail Gun in the leg
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Let's evaluate the potential misery index for the story "You Shoot Yourself With a Nail Gun in the Leg."

This situation involves:

1. **Physical Pain**: Significant, as a nail gun injury is likely to cause severe pain and immediate medical attention.
2. **Emotional Trauma**: High, due to the shock and potential fear related to a self-inflicted injury.
3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: Possible, depending on the severity of the injury and recovery process.

Given the nature of the injury and the associated physical and emotional distress, the misery rating is likely to be quite high. However, this type of injury might not have as extensive long-term psychological impact as some other scenarios.

Estimating an appropriate range for this situation, a reasonable interval could be toward the higher end of the scale.

My final answer for the interval is {{{60 - 80}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 60. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Have Two Vaginas
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Let's evaluate the potential misery index for the story "You Have Two Vaginas."

This story involves:

1. **Physical Pain**: There might be some physical complications, but having two vaginas is more of a medical anomaly than a source of ongoing pain by default. However, it could have some additional complications requiring medical intervention.
2. **Emotional Trauma**: This could be significant, given possible societal reactions, personal identity struggles, or relationship issues.
3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: Could vary greatly depending on individual circumstances but potentially significant due to societal perceptions or personal considerations.

Given the unique nature of this condition, the misery is likely more associated with psychological and social aspects rather than immediate physical pain. It's a complex story that could have profound implications for personal and social interactions.

For this situation, the misery rating could be relatively high due to emotional and psychological factors, possibly falling towards the higher end of the scale.

Given the interval size of 10, let's estimate a reasonable range towards the higher end of the mid-range scale.

My final answer for the interval is {{{70 - 80}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 65. Thank you for playing!
