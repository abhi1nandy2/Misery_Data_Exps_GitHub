Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: A Hawk Steals Your Puppy. Misery Rating = 61
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Brother-In-Law is in Love With You. Misery Rating = 37
## Story: You Accidentally Kick a Baby in the Face
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You Accidentally Kick a Baby in the Face" could potentially involve significant emotional trauma and psychological impact, though it may not involve much physical pain personally. Considering the nature of the event, it might be seen as more distressing than your brother-in-law being in love with you but possibly less miserable than a hawk stealing your puppy, which involves both loss and helplessness. Thus, the story's misery rating might fall between the two situations.

 {{{between}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 35. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Your First Kiss Ever is at Your Wedding
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "Your First Kiss Ever is at Your Wedding" seems less about direct misery and more about societal expectations or personal regrets. It likely involves more emotional and psychological nuances but is probably less distressing than either a hawk stealing your puppy or the awkward situation with a brother-in-law. Given its nature, it could be seen as less miserable than both hypothetical situations.

{{{below}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 21. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You are blinded by hair dye allergy. Misery Rating = 51
## Story 2: A Tooth is Growing in Your Nose
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: A tooth growing in your nose can be physically uncomfortable and might sound bizarre, but it doesn't necessarily present the same level of enduring physical and psychological trauma as being blinded by a hair dye allergy. The allergy results in a permanent and significant change to your life involving vision loss, which seems more severe. Thus, Story 2 likely has a lower misery rating than Story 1.

{{{lower}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 70. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Mistakenly overshare With Your Uber Driver. Misery Rating = 11
## Story 2: Online Dating Match Mocks Your Late Boyfriend
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "Online Dating Match Mocks Your Late Boyfriend" seems to involve a higher level of emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological impact compared to the relatively mild embarrassment of oversharing with an Uber driver. Mockery of a late boyfriend is likely to cause significant distress and upset, so Story 2 likely has a higher misery rating than Story 1.

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 27. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You're Forced to Get a Jaden Smith Tattoo
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You're Forced to Get a Jaden Smith Tattoo" could involve a combination of physical pain from getting the tattoo, potential social embarrassment, and long-term psychological impact if it's unwanted. However, it might not rate as high in terms of extreme misery compared to more life-altering events. Considering these factors, a balanced guess might be somewhere in the middle of the scale, not too severe but not trivial either. 

I'll estimate the misery rating for this story as:

{{{42}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 52. You were off by 10 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Your Hand Gets Stuck in the Toilet and it Goes Viral
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story "Your Hand Gets Stuck in the Toilet and it Goes Viral" includes both physical discomfort and a significant potential for embarrassment due to the social aspect of the incident going viral. This could lead to moderate emotional trauma and psychological impact due to public shame. Considering these factors, I'll choose an estimate near the middle of the scale to account for both the physical aspect and the public embarrassment.

Given the interval size of 30, my estimation interval is:

{{{35 - 65}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 47. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Nearly Drown in a Wave Pool
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story "You Nearly Drown in a Wave Pool" involves a significant level of physical danger and potential trauma from the near-drowning experience. The physical pain and the acute emotional trauma of such a life-threatening event could result in a relatively high misery rating due to the severity of the experience. 

Considering these factors, I would place this story on the higher end of the scale within the smaller interval range of 20 points. My estimation interval is:

{{{60 - 80}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 66. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: unlicensed doctor Leaves You Wtih One-inch Penis during operation
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story "Unlicensed Doctor Leaves You With One-inch Penis During Operation" involves a severe, life-altering physical change, coupled with long-term psychological impact and emotional trauma. The consequences are likely to be profound in terms of personal and social aspects, resulting in a high misery rating.

Considering the gravity of the situation and the smaller interval size of 10 points, I would estimate this story to be at the very high end of the misery scale. My estimation interval is:

{{{90 - 100}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 93. Thank you for playing!
