Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Send a Nude Selfie to HR by mistake. Misery Rating = 70
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You find Maggots in your Fried Rice. Misery Rating = 45
## Story: You are Attacked by a bear after Reasoning with the bear
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Certainly! Being attacked by a bear, despite trying to reason with it, would likely involve intense physical pain, significant emotional trauma, and a considerable long-term psychological impact. This would be much more severe compared to the given situations. Therefore, my answer is:

{{{above}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 52. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Left your Mic On and Went Toilet
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Leaving your mic on when going to the toilet would be quite embarrassing and could cause significant emotional distress. However, it probably doesn't involve as much long-term psychological impact as sending a nude selfie to HR or as immediate health concerns as finding maggots in your food. Thus, my guess would be that the misery of this situation falls between sending a nude selfie and finding maggots in your food. Therefore, my answer is:

{{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 49. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You go to a doctor. Doctor Borrows $300k from you and  then diagnoses you with Dementia. Misery Rating = 76
## Story 2: You are Fired After Donating Kidney to help your Boss
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Being fired after donating a kidney to help your boss involves both betrayal and significant long-term consequences. This situation would likely have a higher emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact compared to being diagnosed with dementia after lending money, which is also severe. Given these considerations, my answer is:

{{{higher}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You are breastfed until you are 9. Misery Rating = 63
## Story 2: You as a Teen are forced by your parents to Live in Woods for eating a pop-tart
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Being forced to live in the woods as a teenager for eating a pop-tart would likely cause significant emotional trauma and possibly a long-term psychological impact. While being breastfed until 9 might also involve some emotional distress, the experience of living in the woods is probably more severe in the context of this game. Therefore, my answer is:

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 69. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You offend a room of feminist panelists
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Offending a room of feminist panelists may lead to immediate emotional distress and potential social repercussions, but the long-term psychological impact might be less severe compared to some of the more intense situations previously described. Given the kind of scale and context we've seen so far, I would estimate the misery rating to be moderate. My guess for the misery rating of this story is:

{{{55}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 47. You were off by 8 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You discover your wife cheating in your Uber
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Discovering your wife cheating on you, especially in such a public and unexpected way as in an Uber, would involve high emotional trauma and could have significant long-term psychological effects. Based on the severity of this situation and what we've seen so far, I would estimate the misery rating to be quite high. Therefore, I will choose a higher range on the scale. My guess for the interval of ratings is:

{{{75 - 105}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 76. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You are in an Escalator which Speeds Up
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Being on an escalator that suddenly speeds up would likely cause a moment of physical alarm and possibly some short-term emotional distress. However, it probably wouldn't have a significant long-term psychological impact compared to the other stories we've discussed. Considering these factors, I would estimate the misery rating to be on the lower side. My guess for the interval of ratings is:

{{{30 - 50}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 32. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your testicles get stuck in the shower stool
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Getting your testicles stuck in a shower stool would likely lead to intense physical pain and immediate emotional distress. However, the long-term psychological impact might not be as severe as some other situations. Given these considerations and the narrow margin for the interval, I would estimate the misery rating to be somewhat high due to the physical pain involved. My guess for the interval of ratings is:

{{{60 - 70}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 49. Thank you for playing!
