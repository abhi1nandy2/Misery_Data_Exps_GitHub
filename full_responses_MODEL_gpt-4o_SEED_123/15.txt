Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Poison Ivy in Your Mouth and Throat. Misery Rating = 68
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Drop Grandma and She Chips Her last Tooth. Misery Rating = 48
## Story: You Dive Into the High Dive naked
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You Dive Into the High Dive naked" seems like it would be awkward and potentially embarrassing, but it doesn't seem to involve as much physical pain or long-term impact as having poison ivy in your mouth and throat, or the emotional trauma of dropping grandma and chipping her last tooth. Therefore, I would guess this story falls below the misery rating of both hypothetical situations. 

My final answer is: {{{below}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 53. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Get Sucked Into the Escalator
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Getting sucked into an escalator sounds extremely frightening and could involve physical pain and potential injury, as well as significant emotional trauma. It seems worse than dropping grandma and chipping her last tooth, which is rated at 48, but maybe not as bad as having poison ivy in your mouth and throat, which is rated at 68. Therefore, I would guess this story falls between the ratings of the two hypothetical situations.

My final answer is: {{{between}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 75. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You End Up Drunk & Pantless on a Train. Misery Rating = 57
## Story 2: You Drive Your Scooter into a Sinkhole
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Driving your scooter into a sinkhole seems like it could be more physically dangerous and traumatic than ending up drunk and pantless on a train. The latter situation might be embarrassing and lead to some emotional trauma, but the physical danger involved in driving into a sinkhole likely makes it more miserable. Therefore, I would guess that Story 2 has a higher misery rating than Story 1.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Find Human Remains Outside of a Chili's. Misery Rating = 43
## Story 2: You Accidentally Eat Hash Cake at a Funeral
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Accidentally eating hash cake at a funeral could lead to unexpected intoxication and significant embarrassment or inappropriate behavior at a solemn event, which could have long-term emotional consequences. Finding human remains outside a Chili's, while shocking and disturbing, might not personally affect one's behavior in the way being under the influence at a funeral might. I would therefore guess that Story 2 has a higher misery rating than Story 1.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 41. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Cause Your Kid to Get Hit by a Car
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Causing your kid to get hit by a car would undoubtedly involve significant emotional trauma and potentially long-term psychological impact, both for the parent and the child, if they survive. The severity of this incident is likely very high on the misery scale due to the parental guilt and the potential consequences for the child's well-being. Considering these factors, I would estimate the misery rating to be quite high. 

My final answer is: {{{90}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 89. You were off by 1 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Your Towed Car Rolls into Pool
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Having your towed car roll into a pool would likely involve a mix of emotional trauma and financial impact due to the damage to the car and potential liability issues. It's unfortunate, but probably not as personally traumatic or physically painful as other situations seen so far. I would estimate its misery rating to be around the middle range of the scale. Therefore, I'll guess a rating interval that centers around this range.

My final answer is: {{{45 - 75}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 46. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Boiling Butter Poured Down Your Butt and you got burnt
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Having boiling butter poured down your butt sounds like it involves significant physical pain and the risk of burns, which would contribute heavily to the misery rating. The immediate physical pain, potential for serious skin damage, and the embarrassing nature of the situation seem to place this incident on the higher end of the scale. Considering these factors, I would estimate the misery rating to be in the higher range. Therefore, I'll select a rating interval toward the upper part of the scale.

My final answer is: {{{70 - 90}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 81. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Find a Clown in Your Bedroom
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Finding a clown in your bedroom would undoubtedly be a shocking and frightening experience, with its primary impact being emotional trauma and fear. While this incident might not involve physical pain or long-term psychological impact (unless you have a specific phobia of clowns), the immediate emotional distress could be significant. Given these considerations, I would estimate the misery rating to be somewhere in the moderate range but not too high on the misery scale. I'll choose a rating interval that reflects a moderate level of distress.

My final answer is: {{{55 - 65}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 50. Thank you for playing!
