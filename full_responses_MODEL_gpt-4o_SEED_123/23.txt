Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Glass Thermometer Shatters in Your Mouth. Misery Rating = 58
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Your Feet Appear on a Fetish Website. Misery Rating = 30
## Story: A Snake Bites Your Face
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "A Snake Bites Your Face" likely involves significant physical pain, potential fear, and possible long-term psychological impact, such as fear of snakes or trauma from the incident. This misery is probably higher than the discomfort or violation of privacy related to having one's feet appear on a fetish website (Misery Rating = 30) and could also exceed the pain and immediate danger related to having a glass thermometer shatter in your mouth (Misery Rating = 58). Given these considerations, I would place "A Snake Bites Your Face" as above both situations.

My final answer is {{{above}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 62. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Pass Out on Live TV
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Passing out on live TV would likely involve significant embarrassment and a potential emotional impact, but it's not likely to involve as much physical pain or long-term psychological effects compared to the other situations we discussed. 

The rating for having your feet appear on a fetish website is 30, and the rating for a glass thermometer shattering in your mouth is 58. Passing out on live TV might cause more immediate emotional distress than the foot fetish website but less physical pain and long-term trauma than the thermometer incident.

Therefore, "You Pass Out on Live TV" would likely fall between the two misery ratings.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 44. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You are a patient with bizarre form of amnesia and you feel like you are still in 2005 after a routine dental treatment. Misery Rating = 83
## Story 2: You're Trapped in a Coma for 12 Years
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Both stories appear to involve significant long-term psychological impact, but the second story, "You're Trapped in a Coma for 12 Years," suggests a complete loss of awareness and control over one's life during that time, which might involve more severe consequences than a bizarre form of amnesia. While the amnesia from 2005 relates to significant confusion and personal loss, being trapped in a coma for over a decade likely results in profound life changes and irreversible effects upon awakening. Therefore, I would expect the misery rating for "You're Trapped in a Coma for 12 Years" to be higher than the amnesia scenario.

My final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 85. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You're Addicted to Cat Fur. Misery Rating = 57
## Story 2: An Octopus is Stuck on Your Face
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Having an octopus stuck on your face would involve immediate physical discomfort, potential fear, and a possible psychological impact. However, it might not have severe long-term psychological consequences compared to being addicted to cat fur, which implies ongoing distress and likely social or emotional repercussions due to the addiction.

While both scenarios are uncomfortable, the ongoing addiction and its implications might be considered more miserable than a one-time, albeit distressing, encounter with an octopus. Thus, the misery rating for "An Octopus is Stuck on Your Face" might be lower.

My final answer is {{{lower}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 49. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You're Forced to Go Skydiving
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Skydiving can be an exhilarating experience for some, but for someone who is forced to do it against their will, it can lead to significant emotional trauma and anxiety, despite lacking physical pain or long-term psychological impact typical of other severely miserable situations.

Considering that discomforting situations with a significant emotional component but without physical pain or enduring psychological impact can have a rating in the mid-range (the passing out on live TV had a rating of 44), being forced to do something as potentially terrifying as skydiving might fall somewhere higher, yet below instances of physical injury or severe long-term effects.

Therefore, the misery rating for "You're Forced to Go Skydiving" may fall in the mid-to-high range. 

My final answer is {{{52}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 35. You were off by 17 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You are a woman who has 44 Kids by age 36
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Being a woman with 44 kids by age 36 likely involves extreme physical and emotional exhaustion, possible financial burden, and significant stress and responsibility. However, it might not involve the kind of acute physical pain associated with more immediate injuries or the kind of sustained emotional trauma seen in some other scenarios.

Given this consideration, I would estimate the misery rating to be relatively high, perhaps in the range of the mid-60s to mid-90s, reflecting severe life impact without immediate physical harm.

My final answer is {{{65 - 95}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 74. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Bus Breaks in Half at the middle while you are standing in the back
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The incident of a bus breaking in half while you are standing in the back could result in both physical injury and emotional trauma. There might also be lingering effects such as anxiety about transportation safety. However, the incident might not compare in severity to situations involving long-term psychological impacts or severe ongoing distress.

Given this, I'd estimate the misery rating to be moderate, considering both the immediate physical danger and emotional shock without long-term effects. 

My final answer is {{{40 - 60}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 45. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Have a Fork in Your Penis that is surgically removed
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Having a fork in your penis that needs to be surgically removed is likely to involve significant immediate physical pain and some level of emotional trauma, given the sensitive nature of the injury. The situation may also have potential long-term psychological effects due to the nature of the incident.

Considering these factors and the severity of both physical and emotional distress, the misery rating is likely to be on the higher side. Given the smaller interval required for this guess, I'd aim for a high range reflecting the combination of intense physical pain, emotional embarrassment, and potential lasting psychological impact.

My final answer is {{{75 - 85}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 80. Thank you for playing!
