Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.

Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Reel in a Trash Bag of Body Parts. Misery Rating = 67
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Help a Friend Move in 100 Degree Heat. Misery Rating = 42
## Story: You're Almost Run Over by a Truck after falling off a motorcycle
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You're Almost Run Over by a Truck after falling off a motorcycle" could involve significant physical pain from the fall, emotional trauma from the near-death experience, and potential long-term psychological impact such as fear of motorcycles or trucks. Considering these factors, it seems more severe than helping a friend move in the heat but may not be as severe as reeling in a trash bag of body parts. Therefore, it is likely to fall between these two situations.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 79. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Monkey Tries To Kidnap Your Baby
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "Monkey Tries To Kidnap Your Baby" would likely have a significant emotional trauma factor due to the fear and anxiety of a potential danger to your child, and possibly a long-term psychological impact concerning the security of your child in public spaces. This could be considered quite severe in terms of emotional impact, more so than helping a friend move in the heat. However, it may not involve the same level of physical and emotional horror as reeling in a trash bag of body parts. Taking these into account, it seems the story might fall between these two situations.

{{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 59. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Brother Wins Millions while You Win $7 on POWERBALL. Misery Rating = 47
## Story 2: You are drunk and you pass Out Naked in a Bank as you mistook the bank for bedroom
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You are drunk and you pass out naked in a bank as you mistook the bank for a bedroom" has significant elements of embarrassment and potential long-term psychological impact due to public humiliation. This could be considered more severe than the disappointment and envy related to your brother winning millions while you only win $7 on POWERBALL, which mostly involves emotional discomfort. Therefore, I would guess that Story 2 has a higher misery rating compared to Story 1.

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 57. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You are Caught Smelling Your Crotch on TV. Misery Rating = 60
## Story 2: You are a lady. Your odd ear condition makes you unable to hear male voices
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You are a lady. Your odd ear condition makes you unable to hear male voices" involves a significant and potentially long-term impact on daily life due to the inability to hear male voices. This could lead to severe communication barriers, affecting various aspects of personal and professional life. While being caught smelling your crotch on TV involves temporary embarrassment and public humiliation, the hearing condition has a more profound impact on a person's life. Given the factors, I would guess that Story 2 has a higher misery rating compared to Story 1.

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 68. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You fall on your face after stopping yourself from false-starting at the beginning of a track race and lose the race
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You fall on your face after stopping yourself from false-starting at the beginning of a track race and lose the race" involves a combination of physical pain from falling, emotional trauma from the embarrassment and disappointment, and potentially a longer-term psychological impact related to confidence in competitive settings. 

Considering these factors, the situation may not be as severe as more life-threatening or deeply embarrassing situations but involves noticeable embarrassment and disappointment, possibly akin to stories with moderate ratings. 

I would estimate the misery rating to be around 54.

{{{54}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 31. You were off by 23 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Your Psychic Powers Fail - as a psychic and you get hit by car
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: For the story "Your Psychic Powers Fail - as a psychic and you get hit by a car," there is a combination of physical pain from being hit by a car and the potential emotional trauma and embarrassment of failing as a psychic, which might involve a loss of credibility. 

Considering these aspects, the story could fall within a range that accounts for significant physical and emotional trauma. Given that it's the first story of the Bonus Round, requiring a guess within 30 points, I will choose a range that reflects a moderately high level of misery.

I would estimate the range to be from 50 to 80.

{{{50 - 80}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 70. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You're In a Wood War with Your Neighbor
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: For the story "You're in a Wood War with Your Neighbor," this situation likely involves ongoing tension and conflict, which can result in emotional stress and frustration. However, it may not include severe physical pain or long-term psychological trauma. Given these considerations, the misery rating might not be extremely high but could fall in the moderate range due to the persistent nature of the conflict.

The story falls within the Bonus Round with a required guess within 20 points. I will target a range that reflects moderate levels of stress and annoyance.

I would estimate the range to be from 40 to 60.

{{{40 - 60}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 36. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Have 420 Kidney Stones Removed
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: For the story "You Have 420 Kidney Stones Removed," there is likely a significant level of physical pain involved, given the intense discomfort associated with kidney stones. Additionally, the process of removing such a large number of stones could cause considerable emotional stress and trauma, potentially leading to long-term psychological impacts such as fear of recurrence or medical procedures.

Considering these aspects, the misery rating for this situation could be quite high. This is the third story of the Bonus Round, requiring a guess within 10 points. Therefore, I will choose a narrow range that reflects a high level of physical and emotional misery.

I would estimate the range to be from 85 to 95.

{{{85 - 95}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 79. Thank you for playing!
