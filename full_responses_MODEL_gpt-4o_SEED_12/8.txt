Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Are Mistakenly Deported. Misery Rating = 81
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Find Your Grandpa's Diary; Discover He Was a Nazi. Misery Rating = 43
## Story: There's a Live Leech up Your Nose
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the given situations, having a live leech up your nose would likely have a significant physical pain factor and a high gross-out factor, but possibly not as significant an emotional trauma or long-term psychological impact as discovering a Nazi past or being mistakenly deported. Considering these aspects, the misery rating for the leech situation might fall between the two given situations.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 58. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You're a Principal who hired a pole dancer to welcome kindergartners to school
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The situation of hiring a pole dancer to welcome kindergartners involves significant potential for emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact due to public embarrassment and potential job loss. However, it may not involve as much physical pain as having a leech up the nose. Given the ratings for deportation and discovering a Nazi past (81 and 43, respectively), this story likely falls below being mistakenly deported but possibly above discovering the diary. Considering these elements, this situation seems to have a lower overall misery score than both possibilities but could exceed the psychological impact of the Nazi diary by a margin.

My final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 63. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You Meet a Friendly Masturbator. Misery Rating = 38
## Story 2: You Almost Get Carjacked by a Naked Man
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Encountering a situation where you're almost carjacked by a naked man likely involves a high level of fear and potential physical danger, leading to significant emotional trauma and possibly long-term psychological impact. This scenario sounds more distressing than merely meeting a friendly masturbator, which may mostly invoke awkwardness and discomfort. Thus, I would expect Story 2 to have a higher misery rating than Story 1.

My final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 45. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Accidentally Sext Your Dad. Misery Rating = 50
## Story 2: Your Dad Accidentally Sexts You
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Having your dad accidentally sext you might involve more emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact compared to accidentally sexting your dad. The perceived boundary crossing and potential disgust increase the misery associated with the second scenario. Therefore, I would expect Story 2 to have a higher misery rating than Story 1.

My final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 61. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You Suck a Lady's Dirty Foot
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Sucking a lady's dirty foot likely involves significant disgust and an uncomfortable social situation, which can contribute to emotional distress and embarrassment. However, it may not involve as much physical pain as some other situations. Given the factors involved and comparing to previous misery ratings, I would estimate the misery rating for this story to be relatively moderate.

My final answer is {{{47}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 45. You were off by 2 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You found a dead mouse inside your can of Red Bull after taking a sip and feeling something hit your lip.
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Finding a dead mouse in your drink after taking a sip is a highly disturbing situation that would likely cause significant emotional trauma and potential health concerns, leading to a moderate to high misery rating. Considering previous ratings, I would estimate this situation to fall within a range that accounts for these factors. 

My final answer is the interval {{{55 - 85}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 65. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Eat 2 Lbs of Your Own Hair which is then removed from your stomach by doctors
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Eating 2 lbs of your own hair, which then requires medical removal from your stomach, is a highly distressing situation involving significant physical discomfort and emotional trauma. The long-term psychological impact could also be considerable due to the process involved and the embarrassment associated with the medical treatment. Given these factors, this situation likely scores higher than moderate on the misery scale, as reflected in comparable distressing stories.

Considering the ratings of previous stories, I would estimate the interval for this story to capture the likely high level of misery involved.

My final answer is the interval {{{70 - 90}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 71. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Have One Happy Day in 129 Years
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Having only one happy day in 129 years suggests a life dominated by misery, sadness, or dissatisfaction, which by its nature would imply an extremely high level of long-term psychological impact and emotional trauma. This scenario involves an extraordinarily high degree of overall misery when compared to other distressing events, as it touches on profound, existential despair and isolation. Given this context, I would estimate this story to have a particularly high misery rating, near the upper end of the scale.

Considering the need to estimate within a 10-point range, I believe the interval for this story should capture the highest levels of misery.

My final answer is the interval {{{90 - 100}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 45. Thank you for playing!
