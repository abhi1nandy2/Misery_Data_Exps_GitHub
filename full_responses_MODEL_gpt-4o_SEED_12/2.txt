Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You're Taken Hostage During a Bank Robbery. Misery Rating = 67
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You are Stuck in Elevator Overnight with Mariah's X-Mas Song on Repeat as the Elevator Song. Misery Rating = 42
## Story: You and Mom Are Addicted to Cosmetic Surgery
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story of being addicted to cosmetic surgery with your mom involves long-term psychological impacts and possibly emotional trauma, but it might not reach the level of being taken hostage during a bank robbery, which carries extreme immediate danger and emotional trauma. However, it is likely more severe than being stuck in an elevator with an annoying song, which is more of an inconvenience. Therefore, the story likely falls between the two hypothetical situations.

My final answer is: {{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 48. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Faint During Bride's Vows
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Fainting during the bride's vows can be embarrassing and might cause emotional distress, but it doesn't involve the significant long-term psychological effects or immediate physical danger that come with the other situations. It seems less severe than being stuck in an elevator overnight with repetitive music, which has a longer duration and claustrophobic element to it. Therefore, the story of fainting during the bride's vows likely falls below both hypothetical situations in terms of misery.

My final answer is: {{{below}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 58. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You're an Anti-gay Pastor Caught on Grindr. Misery Rating = 74
## Story 2: You Lose an Arm in Grinder
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Losing an arm in a grinder involves significant physical pain and a long-term impact on daily life, which would likely contribute to a much higher misery rating than the social and emotional distress faced by the anti-gay pastor caught in a compromising situation. Given these factors, the story of losing an arm would be considered more miserable.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 96. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Contract Super-Gonorrhea. Misery Rating = 81
## Story 2: Live Tapeworm in Your Brain
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: A live tapeworm in your brain is an extraordinary health situation that could lead to serious physical pain and potentially life-threatening complications, along with significant long-term psychological impact. Contracting super-gonorrhea involves substantial health and social consequences, but it is generally treatable and might not carry the same level of immediate physical danger as having a live tapeworm in such a critical area as the brain. Therefore, the story of having a live tapeworm in your brain is likely to have a higher misery rating.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 73. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: Fired for Letting Kids Drive Your Bus
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Being fired for letting kids drive your bus involves significant emotional trauma due to potential public backlash, loss of livelihood, and guilt over endangering children. It could also have long-term psychological impacts on self-esteem and future employability. However, the absence of immediate physical danger or severe health implications might keep the rating moderate in comparison to stories we’ve seen so far. 

Considering these factors, I would estimate a misery rating of:

{{{62}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 71. You were off by 9 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Doctors Misplace Your Bladder
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story of doctors misplacing your bladder certainly involves significant physical pain and emotional trauma, as well as a long-term psychological impact due to the medical negligence and potential complications arising from such a serious error.

Given this, the misery rating is likely to be quite high. Considering the Index ratings discussed so far, and the severity of this incident, I would estimate the interval for this story on a scale of 1 to 100 as:

{{{75 - 105}}}

(I’ve gone a bit higher, acknowledging the seriousness of the issue, though practically the maximum is 100.)

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 64. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Pop Rocks in Your Vagina
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story of having Pop Rocks in such a sensitive area is likely to cause significant immediate physical discomfort and emotional distress, though it may not have severe long-term psychological or health impacts. It's a bizarre and uncomfortable situation but doesn't reach the severity of life-threatening or debilitating cases. Hence, I would place the rating somewhere in the moderate range.

Considering the index and severity, an interval for this story could be:

{{{40 - 60}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 40. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Butt Dial Your Victim
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story of accidentally butt dialing your victim is likely to involve significant emotional distress due to embarrassment and potential social repercussions. However, it likely lacks immediate physical danger or long-term psychological trauma. Given the nature of this situation, I would expect the misery rating to be on the lower end of the scale.

Considering the scenario and the need to cover the range within a 10-point interval, I would estimate the interval for this story as:

{{{30 - 40}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 52. Thank you for playing!
