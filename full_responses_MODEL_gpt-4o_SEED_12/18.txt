Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Shred Your Knuckles on a Cheese Grater. Misery Rating = 47
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Oops! You Live-Streamed Yourself Masturbating. Misery Rating = 73
## Story: Your Meal Walks off the Plate
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Given the situation where your meal walks off the plate, it sounds quite unpleasant but not physically painful or emotionally traumatic on the same level as the two scenarios provided. Shredding your knuckles on a cheese grater involves physical pain, while live-streaming yourself in a private act involves significant emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological impact. 

Therefore, it's likely that "Your Meal Walks off the Plate" is less miserable in terms of the index.

 {{{below}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 42. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Your Cat Eats Your Squirrel
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: While having your cat eat your squirrel is definitely distressing and might involve some emotional trauma, it seems less severe in terms of misery than accidentally live-streaming yourself in a compromising situation, which has a higher potential for wide-reaching emotional and psychological impact. However, it could certainly be more miserable than shredding your knuckles, as it involves emotional distress from a pet's actions and potential loss. Thus, it seems likely that "Your Cat Eats Your Squirrel" falls between the two given situations.

{{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 55. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Wife divorces You for the Wedding DJ. Misery Rating = 63
## Story 2: You Get Shot in the Heart With Crossbow
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Getting shot in the heart with a crossbow certainly involves an extreme level of physical pain and poses a significant threat to life, which contributes to a high misery rating through both immediate trauma and potential long-term psychological impacts if survived. Divorce, while emotionally and psychologically devastating, typically lacks the immediate life-threatening component. Considering these factors, it's likely that being shot in the heart with a crossbow holds a higher misery index than the divorce scenario.

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 78. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: A Ghost Scares Your Baby. Misery Rating = 53
## Story 2: A Home Invader Watches Your Sleep
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: If a home invader watches you sleep, it is an extremely unsettling and potentially traumatic experience. This situation involves a significant breach of personal safety and security, and it can leave lasting psychological effects due to fear and violation of privacy. In comparison, while a ghost scaring your baby could be distressing, it lacks the tangible threat to physical safety and might not have as profound a psychological impact on an adult. Therefore, the scenario of a home invader watching you sleep is likely to have a higher misery rating than a ghost scaring your baby.

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 62. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: A Stranger urinates on You
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Being urinated on by a stranger is quite unpleasant and involves both physical discomfort and a significant level of emotional trauma due to the violation of personal boundaries and dignity. While it's not life-threatening, it can have lasting psychological effects due to the shock and humiliation experienced.

Considering these factors, I would estimate that the misery rating for this story might be moderately high, likely above situations involving purely emotional distress but below those involving severe physical harm or long-term trauma.

I'll guess the misery rating as {{{67}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 49. You were off by 18 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You're Allergic to Everything including your own hair
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Being allergic to everything, including your own hair, sounds extremely debilitating and involves constant physical discomfort and possible danger. This seems likely to lead to severe psychological and emotional stress due to the inability to engage with the world safely or without potential pain.

Given the potential severity of the situation, I believe the misery rating would be high. I will guess the interval as {{{80 - 110}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 86. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Fly Off a Water Slide
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Flying off a water slide involves the potential for significant physical injury, and the surprise and fear during the event could also contribute to emotional and psychological distress. However, unless there are severe injuries, the long-term psychological impact might not be as lasting as more severe scenarios. 

Taking all these factors into account, I would estimate the misery rating to be moderately high but not at the highest end of the scale. I will guess the interval as {{{60 - 80}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 55. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You woke up without a penis
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Waking up without a penis would likely cause a significant amount of physical and emotional trauma. The situation not only involves the shocking physical aspect but also entails severe emotional distress and long-term psychological impact, including identity and body image issues. 

Considering the nature of this scenario, I would estimate its misery rating to be very high. I will guess the interval as {{{90 - 100}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 95. Thank you for playing!
