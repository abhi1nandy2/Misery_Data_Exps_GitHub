Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.

Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Sit Next to the Bathroom on a 14-Hour Flight. Misery Rating = 28
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Get Stuck in a Meat Locker. Misery Rating = 67
## Story: An Elephant Hits You in the Face
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine the misery rating of the story "An Elephant Hits You in the Face," we consider how the story ranks in terms of physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact compared to the two hypothetical situations provided.

- Sitting next to the bathroom on a 14-hour flight (28) is likely a scenario with significant discomfort and annoyance but relatively low in terms of physical harm or long-term impact.
- Getting stuck in a meat locker (67) involves potential physical danger and possibly severe discomfort, such as hypothermia, alongside a moderate level of emotional trauma.

Being hit by an elephant in the face seems to involve severe immediate physical pain and potential injury, high emotional trauma given the fear and shock involved, and possible long-term psychological impact if the event was traumatic.

Given this analysis, the story likely has a higher misery rating than both hypothetical situations, mainly due to the significant physical pain and trauma.

Therefore, the story should fall above both situations. My final answer is: {{{above}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 45. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Base Jump Into a Cliff
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine the misery rating of the story "You Base Jump Into a Cliff," we need to assess the level of physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact it might entail compared to the two given hypothetical situations.

- Sitting next to the bathroom on a 14-hour flight (28) is primarily about significant discomfort with low physical danger.
- Getting stuck in a meat locker (67) could involve risks of hypothermia and some emotional trauma.

Base jumping into a cliff likely involves a high level of physical pain due to injuries from the impact, significant emotional trauma from the experience, and possibly long-term psychological consequences if one survives.

Given these factors, the rating should likely be higher than sitting next to a bathroom on a flight but might not be as severe or prolonged as getting stuck in a meat locker, which involves survival risks over time.

Therefore, the story likely falls between the two situations. My final answer is: {{{between}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 73. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Mom Talks About Anal. Misery Rating = 38
## Story 2: Your Dad is Sleeping With a Sex Doll
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine whether Story 2, "Your Dad is Sleeping With a Sex Doll," has a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1, "Your Mom Talks About Anal," we need to compare the levels of emotional trauma and potential psychological impact.

- "Your Mom Talks About Anal" has a rating of 38, indicating a certain level of discomfort and awkwardness, potentially causing emotional trauma and embarrassment.

- "Your Dad is Sleeping With a Sex Doll" could involve significant emotional trauma due to the nature of the relationship and potentially more severe embarrassment or long-term psychological impact.

Given the potentially higher emotional and psychological consequences associated with discovering that a parent is engaged in such an intimate action, it's reasonable to assume that Story 2 may indeed involve more misery.

Therefore, Story 2 likely has a higher rating. My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 39. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Doctors plucked an active inch-long parasitic worm From Your Eye. Misery Rating = 70
## Story 2: You Cough Up a Lung-Shaped Blood Clot
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine whether Story 2, "You Cough Up a Lung-Shaped Blood Clot," has a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1, "Doctors plucked an active inch-long parasitic worm From Your Eye," we need to assess the levels of physical pain, emotional trauma, and potential long-term psychological impact.

- Story 1 involves significant physical discomfort and emotional trauma due to having a parasitic worm removed from your eye, which can be a particularly distressing experience. This has earned it a high misery rating of 70.

- Story 2 involves coughing up a lung-shaped blood clot, which sounds extremely alarming and may indicate a serious health concern. This could involve a high level of physical distress and emotional trauma due to the fear and implications of such an event.

Given the potentially life-threatening implications and the shock factor of coughing up a lung-shaped blood clot, it might carry a higher misery rating compared to having a worm removed from your eye. 

Therefore, Story 2 likely has a higher rating. My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 79. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You're Hit Repeatedly With a Baseball Bat as a pinata
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine the misery rating for the story "You're Hit Repeatedly With a Baseball Bat as a piñata," we must consider the levels of physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

- **Physical Pain**: Being hit repeatedly with a baseball bat would involve excruciating physical pain and likely serious injuries, contributing significantly to the overall misery rating.
  
- **Emotional Trauma**: The experience of being subjected to such a violent and potentially humiliating act could cause substantial emotional trauma.
  
- **Long-term Psychological Impact**: The incident could lead to long-term psychological effects, such as PTSD or anxiety, particularly when associated with physical assault.

Given the severe nature of physical harm, emotional trauma, and potential long-term effects, this story would likely rank very high on the misery index, potentially near the highest end of the scale.

With all these factors considered, I would estimate the misery rating to be in the range of severe traumatic experiences. Therefore, my final answer for the misery rating would be: {{{92}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 50. You were off by 42 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Keep Getting Dropped From a Stretcher during a soccer match
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the rating interval for the story "You Keep Getting Dropped From a Stretcher during a soccer match," let's evaluate the three pillars of misery:

- **Physical Pain**: Being dropped from a stretcher can cause significant physical discomfort or minor injuries, but it's unlikely to be as severe as being hit with a baseball bat.
  
- **Emotional Trauma**: The situation can be embarrassing and distressing, especially in front of a public crowd, contributing to emotional trauma.
  
- **Long-term Psychological Impact**: While it may lead to frustration or anxiety, the long-term impact might not be as profound compared to more traumatic experiences.

Considering these factors, its misery rating is likely moderate. Not as mild as sitting next to a bathroom on a flight but certainly below the extreme experiences we've assessed.

Given the typical ratings seen so far, I would estimate a range starting from around the mid-30s to mid-60s.

Therefore, my final answer for the rating interval is: {{{35 - 65}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 49. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Allergic to Your Husband's Semen
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the rating interval for the story "Allergic to Your Husband's Semen," we need to consider the potential impact across the three pillars of misery:

- **Physical Pain**: Allergic reactions can range from mild discomfort to severe reactions, which could affect intimacy and everyday life.

- **Emotional Trauma**: This condition could cause significant emotional distress due to its impact on a romantic relationship, leading to feelings of frustration or anxiety.

- **Long-term Psychological Impact**: The situation may have a long-term psychological effect on both partners, potentially affecting self-esteem and intimacy over time.

Given these factors, this story likely has a moderate to high misery rating but not as extreme as some of the more physically or life-threatening stories. The emotional and intimate aspects add complexity but do not necessarily push it to the highest echelons of misery.

Based on these considerations, and given the pattern of ratings seen so far, I would estimate a range in the mid to higher end of the scale but not too close to the top.

Therefore, my final answer for the rating interval is: {{{55 - 75}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 76. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Lose Half Your Head due to drugs lab explosion
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the rating interval for the story "You Lose Half Your Head due to a drugs lab explosion," we need to evaluate the severity across the three pillars of misery:

- **Physical Pain**: This scenario involves extreme physical trauma due to losing part of the head, resulting in catastrophic injuries and possibly life-threatening conditions.
  
- **Emotional Trauma**: The trauma would be immense, stemming from the injury itself and the dramatic life changes it would invoke in both oneself and one's loved ones.
  
- **Long-term Psychological Impact**: The psychological impact would be profound, including potential disfigurement, disability, and considerable lifestyle adjustments. This could lead to severe long-term mental health issues such as depression and PTSD.

Given the life-altering nature of such an incident, it is likely that this story ranks extremely high on the misery index, probably among the most severe cases considered.

Therefore, based on the pattern of ratings seen so far and the severity of the story, I would estimate the range to be very near the top of the scale.

My final answer for the rating interval is: {{{90 - 100}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 97. Thank you for playing!
