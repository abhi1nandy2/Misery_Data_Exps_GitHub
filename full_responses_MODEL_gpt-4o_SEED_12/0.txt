Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Send a Nude Selfie to HR by mistake. Misery Rating = 70
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You find Maggots in your Fried Rice. Misery Rating = 45
## Story: You are Attacked by a bear after Reasoning with the bear
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story of being attacked by a bear after reasoning with it sounds extremely miserable, likely involving significant physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact. This would likely have a high misery rating. Therefore, it falls above both the hypothetical situations given.

My final answer is: {{{above}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 52. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Left your Mic On and Went Toilet
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Leaving your mic on while going to the toilet is certainly embarrassing and could result in some emotional distress, but it doesn’t seem as physically painful or traumatically impactful as being attacked by a bear or sending a nude selfie to HR. It’s likely to be more miserable than finding maggots in your fried rice but less so than sending a nude to HR. 

My final answer is: {{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 49. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You go to a doctor. Doctor Borrows $300k from you and  then diagnoses you with Dementia. Misery Rating = 76
## Story 2: You are Fired After Donating Kidney to help your Boss
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Both stories are quite miserable but in different ways. Story 1 involves substantial financial loss and a devastating medical diagnosis, which would have major emotional and psychological impact. Story 2, however, involves a significant betrayal and loss of employment after making a life-changing sacrifice. Both stories would rate high on the misery scale, but being fired after donating a kidney might be perceived as more emotionally traumatic due to the deep breach of trust and sacrifice involved.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 69. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You are breastfed until you are 9. Misery Rating = 63
## Story 2: You as a Teen are forced by your parents to Live in Woods for eating a pop-tart
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Both stories involve challenging childhood experiences that could have significant long-term psychological impacts. Story 1, being breastfed until age 9, is likely considered socially awkward and potentially embarrassing, which affects emotional and social development. 

Story 2, being forced to live in the woods for eating a pop-tart, involves a form of punishment and abandonment that could result in higher levels of emotional trauma and potential physical hardship. This type of experience might be seen as more severe.

Therefore, my final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 69. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You offend a room of feminist panelists
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Offending a room of feminist panelists could lead to significant social embarrassment and emotional distress, especially depending on the context and potential backlash. However, it likely does not have the same level of physical pain or long-term psychological impact as some other scenarios.

Given the nature of the story, I would estimate its misery rating to be moderate. 

My final answer is: {{{58}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 47. You were off by 11 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You discover your wife cheating in your Uber
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Discovering your wife cheating in an Uber would likely involve intense emotional trauma and shock. It could have significant psychological impact due to the betrayal. Given these factors, the story would likely have a moderately high misery rating. Choosing an interval that encompasses the potential rating is crucial.

For instance, a possible interval could be: 

My final answer is: {{{60 - 90}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 76. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You are in an Escalator which Speeds Up
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: You are in an escalator that suddenly speeds up, which could lead to some immediate physical fear and possibly a risk of injury. However, compared to more emotionally or psychologically damaging stories, this situation might be considered less severe on the misery scale. It could have some adrenaline and panic elements but likely doesn’t carry as much long-term impact.

Given these considerations, a reasonable interval might be:

My final answer is: {{{30 - 50}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 32. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your testicles get stuck in the shower stool
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Getting your testicles stuck in a shower stool would likely be a situation causing significant physical pain and immediate distress. While it might not have a substantial long-term psychological impact like some of the other stories, the physical pain and acute embarrassment factor would potentially give it a moderate to high misery rating.

Given the required precision of this final interval and considering the nature of this scenario, I would choose an interval that likely captures these factors:

My final answer is: {{{55 - 65}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 49. Thank you for playing!
