Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You find Out Via Venmo that your Partner is Cheating. Misery Rating = 68
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Your Chinese Symbol Tattoo Means Big Load. Misery Rating = 45
## Story: A Car Knocks You into a Sewer and you needed surgery for a spinal cord injury
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Considering the gravity of the story where a car knocks you into a sewer leading to a spinal cord injury requiring surgery, it is likely more miserable than finding out your partner is cheating via Venmo and definitely more serious than a tattoo mishap. Therefore, the story's misery rating would likely be above both hypothetical situations.

My final answer is {{{above}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 73. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Have a Really Big Toe
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Having a really big toe seems to be significantly less severe in terms of the Three Pillars of Misery—physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact—compared to both discovering infidelity via Venmo and a tattoo mishap. Therefore, the story's misery rating would likely fall below both hypothetical situations.

My final answer is {{{below}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 56. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Salsa Gets Tea-Bagged. Misery Rating = 51
## Story 2: You're Stuck in a Public Toilet
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Being stuck in a public toilet might be more miserable than discovering someone tampered with your salsa. It could lead to physical discomfort, emotional embarrassment, and a sense of helplessness, which may have more impact on the misery scale than the temporary disgust or anger from a salsa incident. Therefore, I believe Story 2 has a higher misery rating.

My final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 66. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Your Wine Cellar Self-Destructs on You. Misery Rating = 54
## Story 2: You Get KO'd by a Cat
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Getting knocked out by a cat seems quite unusual and could be more embarrassing or amusing rather than seriously miserable. While it would potentially involve some physical pain, the long-term impact might be less severe than the devastation of losing your entire wine collection, which could involve significant financial loss and emotional distress. Therefore, I believe Story 2 has a lower misery rating compared to Story 1.

My final answer is {{{lower}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 52. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You are covered in hair removal strips
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Getting covered in hair removal strips sounds like it could involve significant physical discomfort and embarrassment. The physical pain from removing the strips and the potential emotional trauma from being caught in such a situation contribute to its misery rating. However, the long-term psychological impact might be minimal compared to more severe situations. Balancing these factors, I would guess the misery rating for this story is around 60.

My final answer is {{{60}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 49. You were off by 11 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Get Launched at Work
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Getting launched at work sounds like a situation that could be both physically jarring and emotionally distressing, depending on the context of how and why it happens. Considering potential physical pain and the emotional impact of such an incident occurring in a professional environment, the misery rating might be moderate. Balancing these considerations, I would place the rating at around 55. 

With the interval size being 30 points, I would choose an interval centered around my guess, such as from 40 to 70. 

My final answer is {{{40 - 70}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 59. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You've Been Swallowed by a Hippo 3 Times and you survived
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Being swallowed by a hippo three times and surviving is an extremely harrowing experience. It would likely involve tremendous physical pain, significant emotional trauma, and a long-term psychological impact due to the severity and life-threatening nature of the event. Given these factors, this story would likely warrant a very high misery rating. I would guess the rating could be around 90.

With the interval size being 20 points, I would choose an interval centered around my guess, such as from 80 to 100.

My final answer is {{{80 - 100}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 81. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Blow Yourself Up
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Blowing yourself up is a tremendously severe event with likely catastrophic physical injuries, along with profound emotional trauma and substantial long-term psychological impact. Such an incident would clearly rank very high on the misery scale. Considering these factors, I would estimate the misery rating to be near the top end of the scale, closer to 95.

With the interval size being 10 points, I would choose an interval centered around my guess, such as from 90 to 100.

My final answer is {{{90 - 100}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 89. Thank you for playing!
