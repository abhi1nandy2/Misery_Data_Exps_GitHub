Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Your Henna Tattoo Gives you Hep-C. Misery Rating = 75
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Spill Glitter All Over Your Couch. Misery Rating = 24
## Story: Your Boat Explodes
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the description, the misery rating of "Your Boat Explodes" likely involves significant physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact compared to the other events. It seems more severe than getting Hepatitis C from a henna tattoo and spilling glitter. Therefore, the story probably falls above both hypothetical situations.

My final answer is: {{{above}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 78. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Your Dog Embarrasses you by holding onto your SUV's car horn for a long time
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "Your Dog Embarrasses you by holding onto your SUV's car horn for a long time" likely involves emotional trauma, such as embarrassment, but it doesn't seem to have significant physical pain or long-term psychological impact. It seems less severe than both the situations given, particularly compared to "Your Henna Tattoo Gives you Hep-C." 

My final answer is: {{{below}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 18. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: You Get Stuck In a Grease Vent. Misery Rating = 85
## Story 2: Your Wife Marries Your Stepson
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "Your Wife Marries Your Stepson" likely involves significant emotional trauma and potentially long-term psychological impact, especially compared to being stuck in a grease vent, which primarily involves physical discomfort and embarrassment. Given the personal and relational nature of Story 2, it could be considered more miserable than Story 1.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 86. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You Crash into a Seafood Truck While Masturbating when driving. Misery Rating = 50
## Story 2: Fish is removed from your rectum (by doctors) after sitting on it by mistake
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "Fish is removed from your rectum (by doctors) after sitting on it by mistake" likely involves significant physical pain, embarrassment, and potential long-term psychological impact. Although crashing into a seafood truck while engaging in an embarrassing act involves physical danger and embarrassment, the invasive medical procedure in Story 2 may increase its misery rating. Therefore, it could be considered more miserable than Story 1.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 66. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You're Handcuffed to a Mime for 24 Hours
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the story "You're Handcuffed to a Mime for 24 Hours," there seems to be moderate emotional discomfort and potential embarrassment, but likely limited physical pain and long-term psychological impact. It's an awkward and potentially humiliating situation, but not on an extreme level.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the misery rating for this story to be around 42.

My final answer is: {{{42}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 50. You were off by 8 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Break Your Body on the Escalator
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Based on the story "You Break Your Body on the Escalator," this scenario likely involves significant physical pain from the injuries sustained, potential emotional trauma from the accident itself, and possible long-term psychological impact depending on the severity of the injuries. Given these factors, this story is likely to receive a relatively high misery rating.

The interval for your guess needs to cover the rating within 30 points. Considering the nature of the accident, I would estimate the rating to be fairly high. Let's guess an interval starting at 60 to 90 to cover a broad range while considering possible lower or higher ratings.

My final answer is: {{{60 - 90}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 57. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You're Stuck in the pavement hole for Two Hours
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: For the story "You're Stuck in the pavement hole for Two Hours," this scenario likely involves some physical discomfort and a level of emotional distress due to the embarrassing situation. However, it may not have significant long-term psychological impact unless there are additional factors or severity involved. This suggests a moderate misery rating, as it's unpleasant but not necessarily extreme.

Considering the need to cover the rating within a 20-point interval, I would estimate the rating to be somewhere in the mid-range. Let’s guess an interval from 30 to 50 to take into account both potential underestimation and overestimation of the scenario's impact.

My final answer is: {{{30 - 50}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 72. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Get Hit by a Drift Car
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Based on the story "You Get Hit by a Drift Car," this scenario likely involves significant physical pain and potential for long-term injury, as well as emotional trauma from the sudden and unexpected accident. Given the severity of the physical impact and its consequences, this story is likely to receive a high misery rating.

Considering the need to guess the rating accurately within a 10-point interval, I would estimate the rating to fall in a higher range. Therefore, let's choose an interval from 80 to 90.

My final answer is: {{{80 - 90}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 75. Thank you for playing!
