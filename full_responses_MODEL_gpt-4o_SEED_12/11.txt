Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.

Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Botch The National Anthem on TV. Misery Rating = 56
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Choke on a Crumpet During High Tea. Misery Rating = 39
## Story: You Find Out Your Lover is Your Brother
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To evaluate the misery of the story "You Find Out Your Lover is Your Brother," let's consider the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

1. **Physical Pain**: There isn't any direct physical pain involved in this story.
2. **Emotional Trauma**: Discovering that your lover is actually your sibling would likely result in significant emotional trauma. This kind of revelation can lead to feelings of disgust, betrayal, and confusion.
3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: This situation could have a profound and lasting psychological impact, affecting relationships with family and creating ongoing emotional stress. It can also lead to identity and trust issues.

Given the high levels of emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact, this story seems more severe than both choking on a crumpet (rating = 39) and botching the National Anthem on TV (rating = 56). Therefore, the story's misery rating would likely be above both situations.

My final answer is: {{{above}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 79. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Shoot Yourself During Gun Demo
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To evaluate the misery of the story "You Shoot Yourself During Gun Demo," let's consider the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

1. **Physical Pain**: This situation involves significant physical pain, as shooting oneself would likely cause serious injury and immediate intense pain.
2. **Emotional Trauma**: There could be substantial emotional trauma from accidentally shooting oneself, possibly including feelings of embarrassment, fear, and regret.
3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: The long-term impact could include trauma from the experience, possible lingering physical issues, and a change in perception about handling firearms. It could also affect one's self-confidence and possibly lead to mental health struggles such as PTSD.

Given the presence of both significant physical pain and potential long-term psychological impact, this story seems more severe than choking on a crumpet (rating = 39), and potentially more severe than botching the National Anthem on TV (rating = 56), depending on the extent of the injuries and emotional trauma involved.

My guess is that the misery rating for this story falls above both hypothetical situations. Therefore, my final answer is: {{{above}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 78. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Neighbors Have the Loudest Sex in NY. Misery Rating = 34
## Story 2: You Have Rubbish Teeth
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine whether "You Have Rubbish Teeth" has a higher or lower misery rating compared to "Your Neighbors Have the Loudest Sex in NY," let's evaluate both scenarios based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

1. **Physical Pain**:
   - "Your Neighbors Have the Loudest Sex in NY": There is no direct physical pain involved.
   - "You Have Rubbish Teeth": This can lead to physical pain, as having poor dental health can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty eating.

2. **Emotional Trauma**:
   - "Your Neighbors Have the Loudest Sex in NY": This might cause annoyance or embarrassment, but likely not severe emotional trauma.
   - "You Have Rubbish Teeth": This can lead to feelings of embarrassment, low self-esteem, and social anxiety, especially if it affects one’s appearance.

3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**:
   - "Your Neighbors Have the Loudest Sex in NY": Likely minimal long-term impact.
   - "You Have Rubbish Teeth": Poor dental health could lead to ongoing self-consciousness, affect social interactions, and cause distress about health or appearance.

Given the potential for both physical pain and significant long-term psychological impact, "You Have Rubbish Teeth" is likely to have a higher misery rating than the inconvenience and annoyance caused by noisy neighbors.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 50. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Your Head Gets Stuck in Subway Doors. Misery Rating = 59
## Story 2: You Get Hit by a Bus
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To determine whether "You Get Hit by a Bus" has a higher or lower misery rating compared to "Your Head Gets Stuck in Subway Doors," let's evaluate both scenarios based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

1. **Physical Pain**:
   - "Your Head Gets Stuck in Subway Doors": This likely involves some physical pain and discomfort from being trapped, as well as possible injuries.
   - "You Get Hit by a Bus": This scenario would likely involve severe physical pain, potential life-threatening injuries, and significant medical intervention.

2. **Emotional Trauma**:
   - "Your Head Gets Stuck in Subway Doors": This might cause embarrassment and fear during and shortly after the incident.
   - "You Get Hit by a Bus": This would likely result in significant emotional trauma, fear, and shock from experiencing such a severe accident.

3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**:
   - "Your Head Gets Stuck in Subway Doors": While the incident might be unpleasant, it is unlikely to have a substantial long-term psychological impact.
   - "You Get Hit by a Bus": This could lead to long-term psychological issues, including PTSD, anxiety about road safety, and ongoing health problems.

Given the significantly greater physical pain and long-term psychological impact of being hit by a bus compared to having one's head stuck in subway doors, it is likely that "You Get Hit by a Bus" has a higher misery rating.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 88. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You slip and Break Your Face on TV
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To estimate the misery rating of the story "You Slip and Break Your Face on TV," let's consider the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

1. **Physical Pain**: Breaking your face would cause considerable physical pain and likely require medical treatment such as surgery, which adds to the physical misery.

2. **Emotional Trauma**: The incident happening on TV adds to the emotional trauma due to public embarrassment. People might replay the incident, increasing the feeling of exposure and humiliation.

3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: The long-term impact could include permanent physical changes, ongoing medical issues, and possible self-consciousness about one's appearance. The embarrassment of the event being televised could also have lasting psychological effects.

Considering these factors and the potential severity of each pillar, I would estimate a reasonably high misery rating.

My final answer is: {{{72}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 63. You were off by 9 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Rats Steal Your Toddler's Snacks
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the misery rating range for the story "Rats Steal Your Toddler's Snacks," let's consider the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

1. **Physical Pain**: There is no direct physical pain involved in this scenario.

2. **Emotional Trauma**: The incident can be unsettling. The parent might feel a strong sense of anxiety or disgust due to the presence of rats around their child. It could also evoke feelings of helplessness or frustration at the situation.

3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: While the incident may disturb parents or caregivers, it might not have a substantial long-term psychological impact unless the rats cause significant harm or create ongoing problems.

Given these considerations, the story likely has a relatively low to moderate misery rating. It is certainly less severe compared to physically injurious or life-threatening incidents but might still be a noticeable inconvenience or gross experience, suggesting a moderate rating.

Considering the margin of error allowance, let's place the rating estimate moderately:

My final answer is: {{{25-55}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 33. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Fall During the Changing of the Guard
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the misery rating range for the story "You Fall During the Changing of the Guard," let's consider the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

1. **Physical Pain**: The fall could result in minor physical pain or injuries, depending on the severity of the fall.

2. **Emotional Trauma**: Falling in such a public setting could be embarrassing, especially if it happens during a formal event like the Changing of the Guard. The public nature of the event might amplify feelings of embarrassment or humiliation.

3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: While the incident may be embarrassing, it is unlikely to have a significant long-term psychological impact unless it results in a serious injury or becomes extremely viral or notorious.

Given these considerations, the story likely has a moderate misery rating. It's more embarrassing than some situations but does not involve considerable physical harm or lasting psychological trauma, suggesting a moderate impact.

Given the margin of error allowance, let's aim for a reasonable estimate within the moderate range:

My final answer is: {{{40-60}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 37. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Husband Bulldozes Your House while you were out
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To estimate the misery rating range for the story "Husband Bulldozes Your House while you were out," let's consider the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

1. **Physical Pain**: There is no direct physical pain involved in this scenario, assuming no one was harmed during the bulldozing.

2. **Emotional Trauma**: The emotional trauma could be significant. Losing your home unexpectedly is a major life upheaval, and knowing that your partner was responsible adds a layer of betrayal and shock.

3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: The long-term impact can be severe. Losing a home means losing memories, belongings, and security. It can lead to housing instability and financial strain and may have lasting effects on trust and mental health due to betrayal by a loved one.

Given these considerations, the story likely has a high misery rating due to the emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact, even without physical pain.

With a narrow margin of error for this question, my estimate would be within a higher range:

My final answer is: {{{80-90}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 65. Thank you for playing!
