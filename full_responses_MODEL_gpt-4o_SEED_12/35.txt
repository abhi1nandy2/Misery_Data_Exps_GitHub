Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: You Reel in a Trash Bag of Body Parts. Misery Rating = 67
## Hypothetical Situation 2: You Help a Friend Move in 100 Degree Heat. Misery Rating = 42
## Story: You're Almost Run Over by a Truck after falling off a motorcycle
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: In the given story, "You're Almost Run Over by a Truck after falling off a motorcycle," there is a combination of physical danger and emotional distress, although it's hard to quantify without fully understanding the context. Given the hypothetical situations provided:

- "You Reel in a Trash Bag of Body Parts" (Misery Rating = 67) likely involves extreme emotional trauma and potential psychological impact.
- "You Help a Friend Move in 100 Degree Heat" (Misery Rating = 42) primarily involves physical discomfort with minimal emotional trauma or psychological impact.

The story of almost being run over by a truck seems to involve severe immediate physical threat and potential lasting psychological impact, suggesting a higher misery rating than simply moving in the heat, but perhaps not as impactful as the traumatic discovery of body parts. Therefore, it seems reasonable to deduce that the misery rating likely falls between the two hypothetical situations.

My final answer is: {{{between}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 79. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: Monkey Tries To Kidnap Your Baby
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: In the story "Monkey Tries To Kidnap Your Baby," there's significant emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological impact associated with the distress and danger to a child, possibly comparable to intense threat situations. Evaluating the two hypothetical situations:

- "You Reel in a Trash Bag of Body Parts" (Misery Rating = 67) involves extreme emotional trauma and psychological disturbance.
- "You Help a Friend Move in 100 Degree Heat" (Misery Rating = 42) involves primarily physical discomfort.

The attempted kidnapping by a monkey likely involves considerable emotional trauma and potential for a lasting psychological impact, possibly even more than discovering body parts due to the personal nature and potential harm to a loved one.

Therefore, it seems plausible that the misery rating for "Monkey Tries To Kidnap Your Baby" might be higher than reeling in body parts.

My final answer is: {{{above}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 59. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Brother Wins Millions while You Win $7 on POWERBALL. Misery Rating = 47
## Story 2: You are drunk and you pass Out Naked in a Bank as you mistook the bank for bedroom
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: In the comparison between the two stories:

1. **Story 1**: "Your Brother Wins Millions while You Win $7 on POWERBALL" involves feelings of envy, disappointment, and maybe some emotional impact due to the personal relationship and the stark contrast in outcomes. However, it likely doesn't have significant physical danger or long-term psychological trauma.
   
2. **Story 2**: "You are drunk and you pass out naked in a bank as you mistook the bank for bedroom" includes embarrassment, potential social stigma, and possibly some legal repercussions. This situation may include elements of emotional trauma due to public exposure and embarrassment.

Given these considerations, the humiliation and potential long-term social consequences of Story 2 might suggest a higher misery rating than the envy and disappointment of Story 1.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 57. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You are Caught Smelling Your Crotch on TV. Misery Rating = 60
## Story 2: You are a lady. Your odd ear condition makes you unable to hear male voices
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: In the comparison between the two stories:

1. **Story 1**: "You are Caught Smelling Your Crotch on TV" involves significant embarrassment and potential social ridicule, given the public nature of the incident. This can lead to short-term emotional trauma but likely lacks long-term psychological impact.

2. **Story 2**: "You are a lady. Your odd ear condition makes you unable to hear male voices" involves an unusual condition that could severely impact day-to-day interactions, potentially leading to social isolation, communication difficulties, and long-term psychological effects due to the chronic nature of the condition.

Considering the potential long-term implications and impacts on daily life for Story 2, it might suggest a higher misery rating than the acute embarrassment of Story 1.

My final answer is: {{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 68. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: You fall on your face after stopping yourself from false-starting at the beginning of a track race and lose the race
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: In evaluating the story "You fall on your face after stopping yourself from false-starting at the beginning of a track race and lose the race," we should consider the following:

- **Physical Pain**: There is likely some physical pain involved in falling on one's face, though it may not be severe.
- **Emotional Trauma**: Significant emotional impact and embarrassment, especially in a competitive context, where hopes and preparation might have been dashed publicly.
- **Long-term Psychological Impact**: There might be some lasting impact, especially if the event was highly significant or the race was important to the contestant.

Given the combination of immediate physical discomfort, the acute embarrassment of the event, and the emotional distress from losing the race, the overall misery rating might be considered moderate. It is likely lower than some of the more extreme scenarios but certainly involves notable distress.

My best estimate for the misery rating for this story would be:

{{{52}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 31. You were off by 21 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: Your Psychic Powers Fail - as a psychic and you get hit by car
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: In the story "Your Psychic Powers Fail - as a psychic and you get hit by car," we can consider the following:

- **Physical Pain**: Being hit by a car implies significant physical pain and potential injury.
- **Emotional Trauma**: As a psychic, there might be additional emotional trauma related to the perceived failure of one’s professional abilities, along with the shock of the accident.
- **Long-term Psychological Impact**: There could be considerable long-term psychological impact due to the accident and possible disruption to professional identity.

Given these factors, we are looking at a potentially high misery rating due to the severity of the accident and its implications. We want to cover a range that captures this level of distress.

I will choose a range that reflects a high level of misery, likely above the middle of the scale. 

My final answer for the interval is: 

{{{60 - 90}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 70. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You're In a Wood War with Your Neighbor
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: In evaluating the story "You're In a Wood War with Your Neighbor," let's consider the different aspects that might contribute to the misery rating:

- **Physical Pain**: This scenario likely involves little to no physical pain unless the conflict escalates to physical confrontations.
- **Emotional Trauma**: Ongoing conflict with a neighbor can lead to significant emotional distress, especially if it's a persistent and escalating situation.
- **Long-term Psychological Impact**: There could be a lasting psychological impact due to the stress and anxiety of dealing with a hostile neighbor, affecting one's peace of mind and sense of security at home.

Considering these factors, this situation involves significant stress and emotional strain, but it's likely more moderate compared to life-threatening or deeply traumatic events. For a rating with a 20-point margin, I would place it somewhere within a moderate-to-high range due to the conflict's ongoing nature.

My final answer for the interval is:

{{{50 - 70}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 36. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Have 420 Kidney Stones Removed
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: In considering the story "You Have 420 Kidney Stones Removed," we must evaluate the following factors:

- **Physical Pain**: Kidney stones are known to be extremely painful, and having 420 removed suggests severe physical pain and discomfort over potentially a long period.
- **Emotional Trauma**: The experience of enduring such intense and recurring pain can lead to significant emotional distress.
- **Long-term Psychological Impact**: There might be lasting psychological effects, especially if the process of removal is lengthy or if there are complications during recovery.

Given the extreme level of physical pain and the cumulative emotional impact of such a daunting medical ordeal, the misery rating for this situation is likely very high.

Considering the need for a tight range of 10 points, I would choose a range that reflects a severe level of misery, close to the upper limits.

My final answer for the interval is:

{{{85 - 95}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 79. Thank you for playing!
