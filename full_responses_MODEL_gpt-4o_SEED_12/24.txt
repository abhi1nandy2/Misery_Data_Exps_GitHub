Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Your Fingernails Fall Off. Misery Rating = 62
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Coworker Keeps Eating Your Lunch. Misery Rating = 37
## Story: You Can't Stop Orgasming
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the description, the story "You Can't Stop Orgasming" likely involves a mix of physical and emotional distress, but it may not reach the level of physical pain associated with "Your Fingernails Fall Off." However, it seems more severe than "Coworker Keeps Eating Your Lunch" due to potential embarrassment and emotional turmoil.

Therefore, I would say it probably falls between the two scenarios.

 {{{between}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 56. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Are Windmilled
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The term "You Are Windmilled" is a bit unclear without context, but assuming it refers to being spun around rapidly by someone else, it could involve a certain level of physical discomfort or embarrassment. However, it likely doesn't reach the physical pain level of "Your Fingernails Fall Off." 

It might still be more miserable than "Coworker Keeps Eating Your Lunch" due to physical inconvenience and potential awkwardness. Therefore, it seems likely to fall between the two scenarios.

{{{between}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 31. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Surprise! Your Husband has a Micropenis. Misery Rating = 59
## Story 2: Surprise! You're Related to Your Husband
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "Surprise! You're Related to Your Husband" likely carries significant emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact due to the taboo and interpersonal implications involved. This situation may be perceived as more distressing than simply discovering a partner's anatomical feature, as it can affect familial relationships and social perceptions.

Therefore, I would say Story 2 likely has a higher rating compared to Story 1.

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 70. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: Your Halloween Fangs are Permanently Attached and you are unable to remove them. Misery Rating = 54
## Story 2: You Grow a Devil Horn and it is taken off
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "You Grow a Devil Horn and it is taken off" suggests a significant physical impact and likely a degree of emotional and psychological distress. However, having Halloween fangs permanently attached could also involve a combination of discomfort and social embarrassment. The intensity of undergoing a medical procedure to remove a horn might add to the misery rating, considering the combined physical and emotional trauma. I would think such a procedure and its implications could be seen as more miserable than the situation with Halloween fangs.

Therefore, I would say Story 2 likely has a higher rating compared to Story 1.

{{{higher}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 72. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: A Stranger Ruins Your UNIVERSAL STUDIOS Tour
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: The story "A Stranger Ruins Your UNIVERSAL STUDIOS Tour" likely involves some emotional distress and frustration, but it probably does not cause significant long-term psychological impact or physical pain. Considering the scale used for assessing misery, this incident would likely be seen as inconvenient and disappointing rather than profoundly traumatic or painful. Therefore, I would estimate a relatively lower misery rating.

Based on this analysis, I would guess the misery rating to be:

{{{45}}}

Host: The rating for the story was 20. You were off by 25 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Super Glue Your Eyelid Shut
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story "You Super Glue Your Eyelid Shut" likely involves a fair amount of physical pain and discomfort, as well as some emotional stress and panic. However, it may not have a long-term psychological impact if the situation is resolved quickly. On the 1 to 100 misery scale, I would expect this story to land somewhere on the higher end due to the combination of pain and temporary incapacitation.

Based on this reasoning, I would guess the interval as:

{{{50 - 80}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 68. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Girlfriend left $5K tip on Your Credit Card because she was angry at you
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story "Your Girlfriend left $5K tip on Your Credit Card because she was angry at you" suggests significant emotional distress and potential financial impact. This type of situation involves betrayal and financial loss, which could lead to considerable stress and emotional turmoil. However, it may not involve as much physical pain or long-term psychological impact as some other stories.

Given these considerations, I would guess the interval as:

{{{50 - 70}}}

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 51. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: A Frog Jumps In Your Mouth
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: The story "A Frog Jumps In Your Mouth" likely involves a momentary shock and some degree of disgust, causing temporary emotional distress and discomfort. However, it probably does not result in significant physical pain or long-term psychological impact. On the 1 to 100 misery scale, this is likely to be on the lower end due to the brief nature and lack of severe consequences.

Based on this reasoning, I would estimate the interval as:

{{{20 - 30}}}

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 39. Thank you for playing!
