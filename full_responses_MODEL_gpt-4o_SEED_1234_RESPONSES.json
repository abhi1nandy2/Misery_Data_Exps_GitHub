    "1_1": "Based on the two hypothetical situations and their respective misery ratings, let's consider the story: \"Your Toes Replace Your Fingers.\"\n\n1. Biting your tongue off has a very high misery rating of 73, which involves significant physical pain, potential for emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact due to speech difficulties and eating problems.\n2. Being attacked by a swarm of bees has a misery rating of 44, which includes physical pain and some degree of emotional trauma, but typically has less long-term psychological impact unless one has a phobia or allergy.\n3. Having your toes replace your fingers, while definitely a bizarre and likely distressing situation, would most likely involve continuous daily inconvenience and potential emotional trauma every time you use your hands; it could affect functionality and social interactions.\n\nGiven this consideration, the misery of having your toes replace your fingers likely involves significant long-term psychological impact and emotional distress. I would therefore place the story's misery rating above being attacked by a swarm of bees but likely below biting your tongue off.\n\nSo, the misery rating of the story falls between the two situations:\n\n{{{between}}}",
    "1_2": "Let's analyze the story: \"You Plummet 30 Stories (you survived it!)\" in comparison to the two hypothetical situations.\n\n1. **Biting your tongue off (Misery Rating = 73)**: This involves severe physical pain and could lead to speech difficulties and eating problems, contributing to long-term psychological impacts.\n\n2. **Attacked by a swarm of bees (Misery Rating = 44)**: While this includes significant physical pain and some emotional trauma, its long-term psychological impact is generally lower, unless there are specific phobias or allergies.\n\n3. **Plummeting 30 stories**: Surviving a 30-story fall would be an extremely traumatic experience with considerable physical pain. The psychological trauma from the experience could be severe, including potential for post-traumatic stress disorder and a strong fear of heights or falling in the future.\n\nConsidering these points, the physical threat and potential for long-term psychological impact suggests that the misery rating for plummeting 30 stories would surpass the misery of both being attacked by a swarm of bees and possibly even biting your tongue off due to the sheer terror and life-threatening nature of the experience.\n\nTherefore, the story's misery rating most likely falls above both situations:\n\n{{{above}}}",
    "2_1": "Let's compare the stories:\n\n1. **Your Parents Leave You in a Corn Maze (Misery Rating = 75):** This situation would likely inflict significant emotional trauma and potential long-term psychological effects, especially if the experience is extended and frightening, creating feelings of abandonment and fear.\n\n2. **You Burn Your Penis Trying to Whiten It:** This situation involves considerable physical pain and the potential for emotional distress due to the sensitive and personal nature of the injury. There could also be long-term psychological impacts due to embarrassment or impacts on personal image and sexual health.\n\nBoth situations are distressing, but the nature of physical pain and the personal impact of an intimate injury might lead to a higher misery rating for Story 2. That said, the psychological trauma from being left by your parents, especially as a child, can be profoundly impactful.\n\nConsidering the specific and enduring nature of each, the long-term psychological trauma from the abandonment, combined with the more immediate fear, might narrowly outweigh the injury and accompanying embarrassment from Story 2.\n\nTherefore, I would guess that Story 2 would have a lower rating compared to Story 1:\n\n{{{lower}}}",
    "2_2": "Let's evaluate the stories:\n\n1. **Wife Buys Newspaper Ad About You and Baby Mama (Misery Rating = 62):** This situation carries significant emotional distress and social embarrassment. The broader audience of a newspaper can affect personal and professional relationships but might be limited to local circulation.\n\n2. **Your Wife Calls out Your Cheating on Billboard:** This situation likely entails even greater emotional distress and social embarrassment due to the high visibility and public exposure of a billboard, which can be seen by a large number of people, including community members, coworkers, and strangers.\n\nGiven the high-profile nature and potentially wider audience reach of a billboard compared to a newspaper ad, the embarrassment and social ramifications are likely more intense, suggesting a higher misery rating for Story 2.\n\nTherefore, I would guess that Story 2 would have a higher rating compared to Story 1:\n\n{{{higher}}}",
    "3": "Let's consider the story: \"You Publicly Ask for Toilet Paper while you are pooping in the toilet.\"\n\n1. **Physical Pain:** This scenario involves little to no physical pain, so it does not contribute significantly to the misery rating.\n\n2. **Emotional Trauma:** There is a high likelihood of immediate embarrassment and discomfort, as this situation is awkward and can lead to feelings of humiliation in a public setting. The level of emotional distress may depend on the setting (e.g., a large public restroom versus a private one with few people around).\n\n3. **Long-term Psychological Impact:** The long-term impact may be limited, as this could be a humorous story to tell later. However, there could be lasting embarrassment if it occurs in a work environment or somewhere socially significant.\n\nConsidering these points, the story likely falls into the moderately embarrassing category but not one with severe physical pain or significant long-term psychological impact.\n\nTherefore, I would estimate the misery rating for this story to be around the low to mid-range of personal embarrassment: \n\n{{{47}}}",

The feeling of being judged or worried about one\u2019s appearance can contribute significantly to the emotional distress.\n\n3. **Long-term Psychological Impact:** The long-term impact is usually minimal, as a pimple is often a temporary issue, though it might cause anxiety if one is particularly concerned about their appearance.\n\nTaking these factors into account, this story likely falls within a low to moderate range on the misery scale due to the embarrassment and discomfort associated with having a visible skin issue.\n\nGiven that, I'll place the misery rating in the lower half of the scale. An interval with a generous range starting from the low 20s to the low 50s should capture the potential rating:\n\n{{{20 - 50}}}",

The initial excitement and joy of thinking you've won a prize can quickly turn into shock, embarrassment, and fear upon realization that you are getting arrested. The situation involves a sharp emotional turn, likely leading to feelings of betrayal, humiliation, and anxiety.\n\n3. **Long-term Psychological Impact:** The long-term impact can vary depending on the reason for the arrest and its consequences. Social standing may be affected if the arrest becomes publicly known, and the personal betrayal might lead to trust issues, especially if this is perceived as a prank or setup.\n\nConsidering these factors, the situation\u2019s misery rating is likely quite high due to the emotional whiplash and potential social ramifications. I would expect it to be in the upper range, perhaps starting from the high 60s to the high 80s, keeping within a 20-point interval:\n\n{{{68 - 88}}}",

The idea of your child marrying an inanimate object could provoke feelings of confusion, disbelief, and disappointment. The concern for your child's well-being and mental state can be very stressful, accompanied by social embarrassment and potential judgment from others.\n\n3. **Long-term Psychological Impact:** The long-term impact may include ongoing stress about your child's life choices and potential alienation or strained family dynamics if the decision leads to tension or conflict. It could also pose challenges in social situations due to the unconventional nature of the marriage.\n\nGiven these points, this situation involves moderate to significant emotional trauma but lacks physical pain. The unusual nature and social implications might increase its misery rating, though it may not reach the extremes of more physically painful or life-threatening situations.\n\nConsidering the above factors, I would estimate the misery rating to fall in the upper mid-range due to the emotional distress and social impact. I'll choose an interval that captures this potential rating:\n\n{{{55 - 65}}}"

However, this is often voluntarily undertaken, which might lower the perceived level of misery compared to being taken hostage.\n- Emotional trauma: The addiction to cosmetic surgery likely implies underlying emotional distress and the pressure of unrealistic beauty standards, which can be considerable.\n- Long-term psychological impact: The long-term effects could be quite significant, given the compulsive nature of an addiction and its impact on self-esteem and mental health.\n\nComparing this to the situations:\n1. Being taken hostage during a bank robbery (Rating: 67) involves intense, immediate fear and trauma, with potentially severe long-term psychological effects.\n2. Being stuck in an elevator with Mariah Carey\u2019s Christmas song on repeat (Rating: 42) is inconvenient and annoying but is relatively short-lived and less physically or emotionally harmful.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that the misery involved in being addicted to cosmetic surgery falls between the annoyance and irritation of being stuck in an elevator and the intense trauma of being taken hostage.\n\nFinal answer: {{{between}}}",

However, it is a momentary incident.\n- Long-term psychological impact: The longer-term impact might be social embarrassment or regret, but it's unlikely to create lasting psychological harm beyond a funny story or mild embarrassment later on.\n\nComparing this to the situations:\n1. Being taken hostage during a bank robbery (Rating: 67) is extremely traumatic with potential long-term psychological consequences.\n2. Being stuck in an elevator with Mariah Carey\u2019s Christmas song on repeat (Rating: 42) is an annoying but relatively harmless scenario.\n\nConsidering these factors, fainting during the bride's vows seems less severe than both being taken hostage and being stuck in an elevator all night, as it primarily involves short-lived embarrassment without substantial physical or emotional trauma.\n\nFinal answer: {{{below}}}",

There could also be anxiety about the media coverage or legal implications, if any.\n- **Long-term psychological impact:** Losing a job, particularly if it garners public attention, can lead to financial stress, damage to one\u2019s professional reputation, and a lasting impact on one's self-esteem and employment prospects.\n\nBearing in mind these factors and comparing to other situations previously rated, this situation doesn't involve direct physical harm but results in a significant emotional and professional setback.

Stories involving medical negligence often have high ratings given their severity and potential for lasting effects.\n\nGiven the nature of this incident, a reasonable rating might fall in a relatively high range.

This situation points to a high level of psychological distress and anxiety due to the perceived breakdown of society and threat to personal safety.\n\nThe paranoia and fear induced by believing in a zombie apocalypse can lead to ongoing stress and psychological impact.

Given the potential for significant emotional trauma from such a large public rejection, I would place the rating somewhere moderately high.\n\nConsidering these factors, my guess for the misery rating is:\n\nMy final answer is: {{{71}}}",
    "4_1": "The story \"Your Pastor is Caught Having Sexy-Time\" involves a complicated mix of emotional and possibly moral disappointment, feelings of betrayal, and community implications.

I'm inclined to choose a rating that captures a moderate reflection of shock and emotional impact.\n\nMy final answer is: {{{50 - 80}}}",

    "4_3": "The story of falling into water and getting inadvertently kicked in the face while trying to propose introduces a mix of physical pain and emotional embarrassment.

It has the hallmarks of an unfortunate accident rather than a deep emotional or psychological crisis.\n\nWith an interval size of 10 and aiming to capture the essence of misfortune coupled with an awkward romantic mishap, my guess would be:\n\nMy final answer is: {{{30 - 40}}}"
