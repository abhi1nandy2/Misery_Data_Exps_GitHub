    "1_1": "Let's analyze the two hypothetical situations:\n\n- Biting your tongue off (Misery Rating = 73): This is a very painful experience, likely involving significant physical pain and potential long-term effects.\n- Being attacked by a swarm of bees (Misery Rating = 44): While this can be very painful and traumatic, it may not have the same level of long-term psychological impact as biting your tongue off.\n\nNow, let's consider the story: \"Your Toes Replace Your Fingers.\" This story sounds quite bizarre and would likely involve some significant emotional and psychological implications, possibly leading to distress regarding body image and functionality. However, the physical pain may vary depending on how this transformation is framed or experienced.\n\nGiven that biting your tongue off (73) is a very high level of pain and trauma, and being attacked by bees (44) is lower, I would estimate that the story about toes replacing fingers would likely fall below the level of biting your tongue off but above the bee attack due to its unique psychological impact.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{between}}}.",
    "1_2": "Let's analyze the two hypothetical situations again:\n\n- Biting your tongue off (Misery Rating = 73): This involves extreme physical pain and could have significant long-term effects.\n- Being attacked by a swarm of bees (Misery Rating = 44): This involves pain and potential trauma, but is generally less severe than biting your tongue off.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the new story: \"You Plummet 30 Stories (you survived it!)\". Surviving a fall from such a height would likely come with severe physical injuries, intense pain, and significant emotional trauma from the experience. The fact that the person survived might lessen the long-term psychological effect slightly compared to a fatal fall, but such a traumatic incident would still likely have a very high misery rating.\n\nConsidering the severity of the fall, I believe this story would rate above both the biting tongue off scenario (73) due to the extreme physical pain and psychological trauma involved. \n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{above}}}.",
    "2_1": "Let's analyze the two stories:\n\n- **Story 1: Your Parents Leave You in a Corn Maze (Misery Rating = 75)**: This story involves emotional trauma, particularly feelings of abandonment and fear when left alone in an unfamiliar place. Depending on the child's age and personality, this could have significant psychological effects.\n\n- **Story 2: You Burn Your Penis Trying to Whiten It**: This story likely involves a high level of physical pain and discomfort, as well as potential long-term psychological effects due to the embarrassment and shame associated with such an incident. The injury could also lead to serious physical repercussions.\n\nGiven the ratings provided, a rating of 75 for the corn maze incident signifies a severe level of emotional trauma. However, burning a sensitive area like the penis often leads to excruciating physical pain, which can overshadow emotional effects and lead to a higher rating.\n\nConsidering these factors, my guess would be that Story 2 has a higher misery rating because of the intense physical suffering involved.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.",
    "2_2": "Let's analyze the two stories again:\n\n- **Story 1: Wife Buys Newspaper Ad About You and Baby Mama (Misery Rating = 62)**: This scenario likely involves significant public embarrassment, emotional trauma, and possibly long-term psychological impact due to the public nature of the advertisement and the feelings regarding the relationship.\n\n- **Story 2: Your Wife Calls out Your Cheating on Billboard**: This scenario also involves extreme public embarrassment, but the impact might be more severe due to the nature of a billboard, which is highly visible and permanent compared to a newspaper ad. The humiliation and damage to reputation could be more intense, leading to greater emotional distress.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe that Story 2, which involves calling out the cheating on a billboard, would likely have a higher misery rating compared to Story 1 due to the heightened level of public exposure and the potential for greater emotional fallout.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.",
    "3": "To evaluate the story \"You Publicly Ask for Toilet Paper while you are pooping in the toilet,\" we should consider the elements of humiliation, embarrassment, and the potential for emotional trauma. Being in such a vulnerable and awkward situation, especially in a public restroom, could lead to significant feelings of shame and distress.\n\nThe level of emotional trauma and embarrassment it could cause suggests a high misery rating, likely in the mid-range compared to the other scenarios we've considered. I would estimate the misery rating to likely be around 60, considering the public nature of the incident and the resulting emotional impact.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{60}}}.",
    "4_1": "To estimate the rating for the story \"You Have a Giant Black Pimple,\" we should consider the psychological and emotional impact of having a noticeable skin issue, which can affect self-esteem and mental health. However, a giant black pimple, while certainly distressing and potentially embarrassing, may not carry as heavy of a burden as many more severe stories we've analyzed.\n\nGiven that it likely falls within a lower range of misery ratings due to the physical presentation without significant long-term effects, I would estimate it might be around a rating of 40.\n\nThus, the interval size of 30 points would suggest the following:\n\n- **LOWER LEVEL**: 25 (i.e., 40 - 15)\n- **HIGHER LEVEL**: 55 (i.e., 40 + 15)\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{25 - 55}}}.",
    "4_2": "To evaluate the story \"You Think You Won a Prize; Actually Getting Arrested,\" we need to consider both the emotional and psychological consequences of this situation. Initially thinking you have won a prize brings a moment of joy, but being arrested immediately following that could lead to intense feelings of betrayal, humiliation, and fear. The sudden shift from happiness to distress in a public context can have significant emotional impact.\n\nGiven the potential for considerable shame, anxiety, and long-term psychological effects stemming from an arrest\u2014especially following a false sense of winning\u2014I would estimate this story might have a misery rating in the range of 60.\n\nWith the interval size of 20 points, the calculation would be as follows:\n\n- **LOWER LEVEL**: 50 (i.e., 60 - 10)\n- **HIGHER LEVEL**: 70 (i.e., 60 + 10)\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{50 - 70}}}.",
    "4_3": "To evaluate the story \"Your Daughter Marries a Roller Coaster,\" we need to consider the absurdity and potential emotional impact of such a scenario. While it may sound humorous or bizarre, it could still have significant psychological implications for both the daughter and the family, including feelings of embarrassment, confusion, or concern about her mental state.\n\nHowever, due to the whimsical nature of the story, it might not carry a heavy emotional burden compared to more severe real-life scenarios. I would estimate the misery rating to likely be around 35. \n\nWith the interval size of 10 points, the calculation would be as follows:\n\n- **LOWER LEVEL**: 30 (i.e., 35 - 5)\n- **HIGHER LEVEL**: 40 (i.e., 35 + 5)\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{30 - 40}}}."

While the choice to hire a pole dancer could be controversial and might lead to distress among parents or the community, it doesn't necessarily imply the same level of long-term psychological impact or physical pain that appears in the first situation. \n\nIt might provoke some emotional trauma or embarrassment, but I would argue it does not reach a point higher than the second situation either. As such, it seems most reasonable to place this story below the first situation and likely above the second.\n\nMy final answer is {{{between}}}.",
    "2_1": "To determine whether Story 2 (You Almost Get Carjacked by a Naked Man) has a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1 (You Meet a Friendly Masturbator), we need to analyze the potential distress and misery associated with each scenario.\n\n- **Story 1 (You Meet a Friendly Masturbator)** with a misery rating of 38 may involve some discomfort or embarrassment, but it could also be viewed with humor or as a non-threatening encounter.\n\n- **Story 2 (You Almost Get Carjacked by a Naked Man)** implies a situation that could involve significant fear and a sense of personal danger. This scenario might lead to emotional trauma and a severe adverse reaction due to the imminent threat to personal safety.\n\nConsidering the nature of both stories, Story 2 likely carries a higher misery rating due to the potential for fear and trauma associated with a near carjacking, compared to the more humorous and less threatening nature of Story 1.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.",

However, one could argue that the emotional trauma might be somewhat manageable, depending on the dynamics of the relationship.\n\n- **Story 2 (Your Dad Accidentally Sexts You)** could imply a deeper level of emotional distress and awkwardness. This situation puts the recipient (you) in a position of receiving an unexpected and potentially traumatizing message from a parent. It might lead to significant feelings of confusion and embarrassment, possibly complicating the parent-child relationship in a more profound way.\n\nGiven that the embarrassment and emotional distress from receiving an inappropriate sext from a parent could be more impactful than sending one, I would argue that Story 2 likely has a higher misery rating.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.",

Sucking on someone\u2019s dirty foot would certainly be seen as socially unacceptable and may lead to significant emotional distress.\n\n3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: Depending on how this experience affects the individual in terms of social relationships or self-image, there could be some lingering psychological implications.\n\nConsidering the above points, the situation seems to involve a notable amount of emotional trauma and social fallout, which can lead to an elevated misery rating. \n\nWhile I am unsure of the exact index, I might place this story at a relatively moderate to high level due to the embarrassment and potential consequences involved. \n\nBased on my assessment, I would estimate the misery rating to be around 70. \n\nMy final answer is {{{70}}}.",

While it might not involve any direct physical pain, the thought of having consumed a dead mouse could lead to a visceral reaction.\n\n2. **Emotional Trauma**: This situation could lead to significant emotional distress, including feelings of disgust, horror, and anxiety about food safety. It may also spark long-term concerns about similar experiences in the future.\n\n3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: Depending on the person, discovering something so shocking and distressing could lead to lasting psychological effects, such as food-related anxiety or aversion to certain products or brands.\n\nGiven these factors, I might estimate that the misery rating for this story is relatively high due to the emotional and psychological implications. If I consider the previous ratings I've encountered, this story could be in the range of 60-90.\n\nFor a 30-point interval, I would estimate the rating to be:\n\n**LOWER LEVEL:** 60  \n**HIGHER LEVEL:** 90  \n\nThus, my final answer is {{{60 - 90}}}.",

The act of having it removed by doctors indicates a serious situation, potentially involving surgery or medical intervention.\n\n2. **Emotional Trauma**: The realization and guilt associated with consuming that much hair could lead to considerable emotional distress. This situation could evoke feelings of shame, embarrassment, or anxiety about one's habits and health.\n\n3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: Depending on the circumstances leading to this behavior (e.g., trichotillomania or other psychological issues), there could be significant long-term psychological effects. The individual may have to deal with the ramifications of such behavior psychologically.\n\nGiven these considerations, this story likely carries a high misery rating due to both the physical and emotional trauma involved. \n\nBased on previous ratings and the severity of the situation at hand, I would estimate this story\u2019s rating to be in the range of 70-90, given the severe implications.\n\nFor a 20-point interval, I would estimate the rating to be:\n\n**LOWER LEVEL:** 70  \n**HIGHER LEVEL:** 90  \n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{70 - 90}}}.",

Experiencing such a lack of joy or fulfillment over an extensive period can lead to deep emotional suffering and may indicate long-standing issues such as depression or severe loneliness.\n\n3. **Long-term Psychological Impact**: The long-term effects of having only one happy day in a lifetime could be substantial. It might lead to chronic feelings of despair, hopelessness, and a diminished quality of life, suggesting a high level of psychological impact.\n\nGiven these factors, this story likely carries a serious level of misery due to the emotional and psychological implications involved. When considering prior misery ratings, a person with this experience could have a misery rating that reflects significant distress.\n\nI would estimate the misery rating for this story to be in the range of 80-100.\n\nFor a 10-point interval, I would place the rating as:\n\n**LOWER LEVEL:** 80  \n**HIGHER LEVEL:** 90  \n\nThus, my final answer is {{{80 - 90}}}."

I'll assume a possible rating could lie in the range of 40 to 70 based on common experiences associated with such a mishap (as something embarrassing that could certainly be frustrating, but not deeply traumatic).\n\nTherefore, considering the 30-point margin, I will estimate the interval as follows: \n\nThus, my final answer is {{{40 - 70}}}.",

However, the focus here seems more on fear and psychological effects.\n2. **Emotional trauma**: For many, clowns can evoke fear or discomfort (coulrophobia), which could lead to significant emotional trauma. The context of finding a clown in a personal space like a bedroom further amplifies the fear and unease.\n3. **Long-term psychological impact**: While some might have a fleeting experience of fear, for others it might result in lasting anxiety or fear of clowns (coulrophobia), but this would be highly subjective.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would estimate the misery rating for this story to be on the lower side of the scale since it's more about fear than physical pain. Based on typical responses to such situations, I would expect a rating near the range of 30 to 50.\n\nGiven that we need to estimate within a margin of 10, I would choose a narrower interval based on these estimates.\n\nThus, my final answer is {{{30 - 40}}}."

Taking into account that this scenario is certainly unpleasant but not extremely miserable, I believe the rating might fall between approximately 40 and 60.\n\nAs such, my final answer (covering a range of 20 points) would be {{{40 - 60}}}.",
    "4_3": "To evaluate the story \"You survived being put through a woodchipper,\" I need to consider the severity and implications of this situation. Surviving such an ordeal would involve extreme physical pain and trauma, which makes it one of the more serious and impactful experiences one can endure. \n\nThe psychological impact of such a survival would likely also be significant, leading to long-lasting emotional and mental health issues. Given the extreme nature of this experience, I would anticipate the misery rating to be very high.\n\nEstimating the rating for such a horrific situation, I would place it in the higher range. I would say a reasonable range considering the intensity of the experience might be 90 to 100.\n\nSo, my final answer would be {{{90 - 100}}}."
