Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.

## Story: Your Best Friend Marries Your Sister
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Let's consider the emotional impact, trauma, and potential long-term psychological effects involved in the situation of having your best friend marry your sister. This can be quite painful due to feelings of betrayal and loss.

Based on similar scenarios and the potential distress they cause, I would estimate the misery rating for this story to be around 70.

My final answer is {{{70}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 45. You were off by 25 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Cliff Dive Into a Boat
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Considering the potential consequences of cliff diving into a boat—such as serious physical injury, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact from the incident—I would estimate that the misery rating could fall within a significant range.

A reasonable guess might be that the misery rating could be anywhere from 45 to 75, encompassing a 30-point margin.

My final answer is {{{45 - 75}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 64. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You reported not many rattlesnakes under home but a removal company found 45
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Considering the surprising and potentially traumatic nature of discovering a large number of rattlesnakes under your home, the emotional and psychological stress this could cause is considerable. 

Given that the situation involves fear, anxiety, and the potential for injury, I would estimate that the misery rating might range from 40 to 60, allowing for a 20-point margin.

My final answer is {{{40 - 60}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 57. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You Get Trapped in a Car Wash
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: Considering the stressful and potentially frightening experience of getting trapped in a car wash, which could lead to feelings of panic and anxiety, the misery rating for this story could reflect both the immediate emotional trauma and the physical discomfort involved. 

Taking into account these factors, I would estimate that the misery rating might range from 50 to 60, fitting within a 10-point margin.

My final answer is {{{50 - 60}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 50. Thank you for playing!
