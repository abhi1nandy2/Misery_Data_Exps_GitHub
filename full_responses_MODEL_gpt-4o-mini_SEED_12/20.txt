Gameplay
The main game consists of three rounds that involve rating and ranking miserable true stories. Ratings are on a numerical scale of 1 to 100, as determined by a panel of psychologists, and are based on the "Three Pillars of Misery": physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.



Round 1: Misery Lane (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, two hypothetical situations are presented to the contestant. The contestant must decide whether a given story falls above, below, or between the two hypothetical situations; a correct choice wins $500.



Round 2: More or Less Miserable (consists of 2 questions)
In each question, the contestant is shown two similar stories and must decide which one earned the higher Index rating, earning $1,000 for a correct guess.



Round 3: Master of Misery (consists of 1 question)
One miserable story is presented, and the contestant must guess its Index rating as closely as possible. The closer the guess, the higher the reward.



Bonus Round: Margin of Misery (consists of 3 questions)
The contestant is shown three miserable stories, one at a time, and must guess the Index rating of each within a specified margin of error in order to win additional money as follows.


First story: $5,000 value, within 30 points 
Second story: $10,000 value, within 20 points
Third story: $15,000 value, within 10 points
The contestant guesses by moving a range finder on a sliding scale, attempting to cover the actual rating, and has 10 seconds to lock in a guess on each story.



You are a contestant in the aforementioned game show. This is the conversation during the gameshow between you and the game show host.



Host: Let's start the Round 1, Misery Lane.  
## Hypothetical Situation 1: Hairdresser Sneezes and Gives You Bangs. Misery Rating = 44
## Hypothetical Situation 2: Your Child Joins an A Cappella Group. Misery Rating = 20
## Story: A Woman Gives Birth In Your Cab
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: Based on the given situations, the first hypothetical (hairdresser sneezing and giving bangs) has a misery rating of 44, which is quite a minor issue. The second hypothetical (child joining an a cappella group) has a rating of 20, indicating a relatively trivial scenario. 

Giving birth in a cab is a significant event that likely involves considerable physical pain and emotional trauma, placing it above both hypothetical situations. 

Therefore, my final answer is {{{above}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 33. Let's go to the next question. 
## Story: You Faint During Your Friend's Wedding
Does the story fall above, below, or between the two situations? Output your final answer as one of either above, below, or between in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: In this case, we have the two hypothetical situations: 
- Hairdresser Sneezing and Giving You Bangs (Misery Rating = 44)
- Your Child Joins an A Cappella Group (Misery Rating = 20)

The story "You Faint During Your Friend's Wedding" involves some physical distress (fainting) and could potentially bring about emotional embarrassment or trauma related to the event, but it may not have a long-term psychological impact.

Considering the ratings, fainting at a wedding likely falls somewhere between the two hypothetical ratings, as it's more serious than joining an a cappella group, but less serious than the pain associated with the hairdresser incident.

I assess it as follows:
- Below 44, likely around the emotional discomfort but more impactful than the lower end of 20.

Thus, my final answer is {{{between}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 32. Let's start the Round 2, More or Less Miserable.
## Story 1: Your Home is Trashed in a Drug-Fueled Orgy. Misery Rating = 73
## Story 2: Your Anger Management Classmate Stabs You
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To evaluate this, we have:

- Story 1: Your Home is Trashed in a Drug-Fueled Orgy (Misery Rating = 73). This involves significant emotional turmoil and financial stress, as well as potential long-term psychological effects.
  
- Story 2: Your Anger Management Classmate Stabs You. This situation involves a violent act that would typically involve extreme physical pain, significant emotional trauma, and potentially serious long-term psychological consequences.

Given that being stabbed is a major violent act, it is likely to have a higher misery rating than having your home trashed. Therefore, I believe Story 2 has a higher misery rating compared to Story 1.

My final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 78. Let's go to the next question.
## Story 1: You are caught after Falling Asleep During Sex in Public in a university hallway. Misery Rating = 52
## Story 2: Dad Steals Your Girl Scout Cookie Money for an Erotic Massage
Does Story 2 have a higher or lower rating compared to Story 1? Output your final answer as one of either higher or lower in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To analyze the two stories:

- **Story 1**: You are caught after Falling Asleep During Sex in Public in a university hallway (Misery Rating = 52). This scenario likely brings a mix of embarrassment and potential social consequences; it involves emotional trauma but may not translate into long-term psychological issues.

- **Story 2**: Dad Steals Your Girl Scout Cookie Money for an Erotic Massage. This situation can induce feelings of betrayal and disappointment, especially since this involves a parent, which could lead to emotional trauma and potential long-term effects on the parent-child relationship. 

Comparing both ratings, Story 1 has a rating of 52. Given the emotional impact of Story 2 and the nature of betrayal felt when a parent acts inappropriately, I would estimate that Story 2 likely carries a higher misery rating.

Thus, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 50. Let's start the Round 3, Master of Misery.
## Story: A Creepy Stranger Watches You Workout
Output your final answer as the misery rating (on a numerical scale of 1 to 100) of this story in three braces, like {{{this}}}.

You: To assess the misery rating for the story "A Creepy Stranger Watches You Workout", I need to consider the physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact it may have.

This situation involves feeling uncomfortable and potentially unsafe due to the presence of a stranger, which can lead to emotional trauma and anxiety. However, it may not involve significant physical pain or long-term psychological scars unless it escalates. 

Given these factors, I would estimate this scenario to have a moderate rating. 

I would guess the misery rating to be around 45. 

Thus, my final answer is {{{45}}}.

Host: The rating for the story was 21. You were off by 24 points! Let's start the Bonus Round, Margin of Misery.
## Story: You Get Bitten by a Snake While Sleeping
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 30) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To determine the interval for the story "You Get Bitten by a Snake While Sleeping," I'll consider the potential physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact.

Getting bitten by a snake can be extremely painful and poses significant health risks, possibly requiring medical attention. This scenario likely carries a high level of physical pain and could lead to emotional distress regarding safety and potentially long-term psychological impacts, especially related to fear of snakes or anxiety from the event.

Based on these considerations, I would estimate the misery rating to be quite high, likely around 70 to 90.

Thus, my final answer is {{{70 - 100}}}.

Host: You are CORRECT! The rating for the story was 70. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: Your Car is Dragged for Miles
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 20) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To evaluate the interval for the story "Your Car is Dragged for Miles," we must consider the physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological implications.

This situation could involve significant physical danger, potential injuries, and a very high degree of emotional trauma, especially if someone is in or around the car at the time. The experience can create anxiety and fear related to driving and car safety, which could have lasting effects.

Given the severity of the incident, I would estimate the misery rating to be reasonably high, likely around 60 to 80.

Thus, my final answer is {{{60 - 80}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 57. Let's go to the next question.
## Story: You are a doctor who Sucks Out a Passenger's Urine for 37 Minutes Mid-Flight to save his life
Output your final answer as the interval of ratings (interval size = 10) in three braces, like {{{LOWER LEVEL - HIGHER LEVEL}}}

You: To analyze the interval for the story "You are a doctor who Sucks Out a Passenger's Urine for 37 Minutes Mid-Flight to save his life," let's consider the level of physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact it could entail.

In this case, the act of performing such a procedure in a high-pressure situation mid-flight involves a considerable amount of stress and pressure for the doctor. This scenario can lead to intense emotional trauma—not only from the urgency and difficulty of the situation but also from the responsibility of saving a life. 

Since this act would also involve physical aspects during the procedure, it could be reasonably concluded that the misery rating would be quite high.

Considering these elements, I would estimate the misery rating to be approximately around 80 to 90.

Thus, my final answer is {{{80 - 90}}}.

Host: Sorry, you are WRONG! The rating for the story was 56. Thank you for playing!
