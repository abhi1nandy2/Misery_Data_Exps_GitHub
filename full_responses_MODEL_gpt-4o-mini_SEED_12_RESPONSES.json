    "1_1": "Based on the provided situations, the story \"You're Caught Lying on TV\" likely has a misery rating that would not surpass the challenging experience of having triplets (60), but also shouldn't be as low as dealing with a drunken parent's complaints about their sex life (27). I would position it as a moderate level of misery.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{between}}}.",
    "1_2": "Considering the story \"Your Landlord pees on Your Lunch,\" it seems more impactful than your drunk mom's complaints about her sex life (27), as it's a rather humiliating and distressing experience. However, it may not be as severe as the challenges of unexpectedly having triplets (60), which involves significant stress and responsibility.\n\nThus, I would say this story falls in a moderate range compared to both scenarios but leans slightly higher than the lower scenario.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{between}}}.",
    "2_1": "Considering the context of both stories, \"Your Breast Implants Make Fart Noises\" (rating 59) involves a somewhat humorous yet embarrassing situation, while \"You Have a Permanent Bald Spot\" can lead to significant emotional trauma and impact self-esteem. Given the potential long-term psychological effects of having a permanent bald spot, I would lean towards it having a higher misery rating.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.",
    "2_2": "In evaluating the two stories, \"Your Parents Terrify You\" (rating 53) suggests an ongoing emotional trauma, while \"You Are Attacked by a Sea Lion\" implies a physical threat that could result in both physical pain and emotional trauma. The unexpected nature of an animal attack could also have a more significant long-term psychological impact due to fear of wild animals or traumatic experiences. Therefore, I would consider the sea lion attack to have a higher misery rating compared to the emotional distress from terrifying parents.\n\nThus, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.",
    "3": "Given the story \"You Go Hang... Gliding,\" it seems to imply a potentially dangerous activity that could lead to serious accidents or injuries, which would involve physical pain and emotional trauma. However, if the phrase is taken humorously or metaphorically, the rating might be lower. Still, considering the risks associated with gliding and the implications of a serious accident, I would estimate the misery rating to be fairly high.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{70}}}.",
    "4_1": "Considering the story \"You are Struck by Lightning 3 Times,\" this certainly implies a significant level of physical pain and potentially long-term psychological effects due to the trauma of multiple lightning strikes. Given the dramatic nature of this experience, I would estimate a high misery rating.\n\nAssuming a possible rating around the upper portion of the scale, I would suggest an interval that reflects a strong intensity of misery.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{70 - 100}}}.",
    "4_2": "Given the story \"Your Surgeon's Mistake Leaves You Legless,\" this represents a profoundly impactful experience involving significant physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological consequences. The gravity of losing a limb suggests a very high misery rating.\n\nTaking this into consideration, I would predict an interval that reflects the extreme level of suffering associated with such an event.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{80 - 100}}}.",
    "4_3": "Considering the story \"You have a Drunken Makeout with an Old Lady,\" this situation could evoke feelings of embarrassment, shame, and potential emotional trauma, but it may not involve physical pain or long-term psychological impacts of equal severity. The level of misery here might be lower than extreme cases, despite its awkwardness.\n\nGiven this assessment, I would estimate a relatively moderate interval for the misery rating.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{30 - 40}}}."

The second situation about your dog eating your neighbor's bunny (misery rating of 35) is certainly unfortunate but comparatively less impactful.\n\nReceiving 65,000 texts after one date suggests overwhelming emotional distress and potential psychological impact, likely ranking it above the second hypothetical but below the first due to its lack of physical pain.\n\nTherefore, I would say the story falls between the two situations.\n\nMy final answer is {{{between}}}.",
    "1_2": "In this case, the story \"Dad Nearly Drowns You for Clicks\" presents a scenario that involves serious physical danger and potential emotional trauma, which sets it apart from both hypothetical situations provided earlier. \n\nThe first hypothetical situation (Explosive Diarrhea Every Time You Orgasm) has a misery rating of 66 and involves both significant physical pain and potential emotional impacts. While the second situation (Your Dog Eats Your Neighbor's Bunny) is rated at 35, it is more humorous and lighthearted in nature with a lower impact. \n\nGiven that the current story involves a life-threatening situation and severe emotional consequences, I believe it ranks significantly higher than both hypothetical situations.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that this story falls above the other two situations.\n\nMy final answer is {{{above}}}.",
    "2_1": "To analyze the two stories, we have:\n\n- **Story 1**: \"You all Prayed the Wrong Way for 37 Years\" has a misery rating of 51. This scenario suggests a long-term emotional impact due to frustration and disappointment stemming from ineffectiveness in one\u2019s spiritual practices over many years.\n\n- **Story 2**: \"You're Not Infertile Just Doing It Wrong (Anal Sex)\" likely involves an embarrassing realization and potential emotional pain related to misconceptions about fertility and sexual practices. However, this situation may have a more humorous undertone and less long-term trauma compared to Story 1.\n\nConsidering that Story 1 has a defined misery rating of 51, and taking into account the nature and implications of Story 2, I lean towards the conclusion that it might have a lower impact than Story 1 due to both the potentially humorous aspect and the nature of the scenario.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{lower}}}.",
    "2_2": "To evaluate these two stories:\n\n- **Story 1**: \"Trapped in Your Tub for 5 Days\" with a misery rating of 59 presents a scenario that likely involves severe physical discomfort, potential dehydration, and significant emotional distress due to the feeling of entrapment and helplessness.\n\n- **Story 2**: \"Python in Your Toilet\" implies an unexpected and frightening encounter that could cause panic and fear, but it may not involve the same level of long-term discomfort or trauma that comes from being trapped for an extended period.\n\nConsidering the severity of the situations, being trapped for 5 days seems to have a more enduring impact than simply encountering a python, which is likely more of a brief shock or fear.\n\nThus, I would conclude that Story 2 likely has a lower rating compared to Story 1.\n\nMy final answer is {{{lower}}}.",
    "3": "To gauge the misery rating for the story \"You Tank a Wedding Toast,\" we should consider the components of embarrassment and social consequences. \n\nA wedding toast that goes awry could lead to significant emotional trauma, particularly if it damages relationships with friends or family present. The implications of personal shame and the potential for long-lasting psychological impact from public embarrassment can be substantial. \n\nConsidering these factors and similar narratives, I would estimate the misery rating to be around 70. This suggests a significant level of distress while still allowing for some context of resilience and humor.\n\nMy final answer is {{{70}}}.",
    "4_1": "To determine the interval for the story \"You Have 232 Teeth Removed,\" I need to consider the physical pain involved, the emotional trauma, and the potential long-term psychological impact of having such a bizarre and extreme dental situation.\n\nHaving 232 teeth removed suggests a significant amount of physical pain, potential embarrassment, and long-lasting effects on one's quality of life and self-image. This leads me to believe that the misery rating would be relatively high.\n\nTaking into account the defined margin of error of 30 points, I would estimate the misery rating to be in the range of 70 to 100 based on the impact of the events described.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{70 - 100}}}.",
    "4_2": "To evaluate the story \"You try to Go to Jail to Escape Wife,\" we need to consider the emotional and psychological implications of such a drastic decision, as well as the potential for physical consequences related to attempting to engage with the legal system in this way.\n\nWanting to go to jail to escape a spouse suggests a significant level of emotional distress, possibly involving feelings of desperation, unhappiness in the relationship, and a sense of hopelessness about the situation. This could lead to considerable emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact.\n\nOverall, I would estimate that this situation, while serious, might fall in a medium range rather than being at the very extreme end. Considering the margin of error of 20 points, I would estimate the misery rating to be around 50 to 70.\n\nSo, my final answer is {{{50 - 70}}}.",
    "4_3": "To assess the story \"You're Stuck on 8 Hour Flight with Demon Child,\" we should consider the extreme mental and emotional strain that would occur from being on a long flight with a disruptive child. The combination of being trapped in a confined space with loud or misbehaving children can lead to a significant amount of frustration, anxiety, and feelings of helplessness.\n\nWhile the situation is certainly unpleasant, it may not involve physical pain, but the psychological impact of such an experience could be considerable. Given that the impact likely varies widely from person to person, I would estimate that the misery rating for this situation could be around 40 to 60.\n\nConsidering the interval size of 10 points, I would set the range accordingly.\n\nSo, my final answer is {{{40 - 50}}}."

    "1_2": "In evaluating the story \"You're a Principal who hired a pole dancer to welcome kindergartners to school,\" I consider the context and implications of this action. \n\n- The situation of mistakenly deported (misery rating 81) involves serious emotional and social consequences. \n- On the other hand, the situation of discovering your grandpa was a Nazi (misery rating 43) involves emotional trauma but is more indirectly related to immediate personal distress.\n\nHiring a pole dancer for kindergarteners likely denotes a profound lapse in judgment but may not equate to severe emotional trauma or long-term psychological effect in comparison to being deported. \n\nTaking these points into consideration, I would rate this story as falling below the first situation but above the second one in terms of misery. \n\nMy final answer is {{{between}}}.",
    "2_1": "In considering the two stories, \"You Meet a Friendly Masturbator\" has a misery rating of 38. Evaluating the second story, \"You Almost Get Carjacked by a Naked Man,\" I would expect that the threat of being carjacked, regardless of the unusual circumstances, would involve more immediate fear and anxiety, potentially leading to a higher misery rating due to the physical danger posed.\n\nConsidering this, I would conclude that Story 2 has a higher misery rating than Story 1.\n\nMy final answer is {{{higher}}}.",
    "2_2": "In analyzing the two stories, \"You Accidentally Sext Your Dad\" has a misery rating of 50. Now, for the second story, \"Your Dad Accidentally Sexts You,\" I would consider the implications and variety of reactions involved. \n\nAccidentally sexting your dad could lead to feelings of embarrassment and potential strains in the relationship, but it is likely a more direct and potentially humorous embarrassment. On the other hand, if your dad accidentally sexts you, it could lead to more profound discomfort, emotional toll, and confusion about boundaries and the parent-child relationship. \n\nGiven these factors, I would deduce that Story 2 likely has a higher misery rating than Story 1 due to the increased emotional trauma and awkwardness that could stem from that situation.\n\nMy final answer is {{{higher}}}.",
    "3": "To evaluate the story \"You Suck a Lady's Dirty Foot,\" I consider the physical discomfort and potential disgust associated with this action, as well as the social stigma and emotional ramifications it might have on the individual involved.\n\n- The physical pain might not be extreme, but there is a strong element of psychological discomfort due to the act itself and what it may imply about personal boundaries or societal norms.\n- Additionally, the potential for long-term psychological impact, such as embarrassment or shame, must also be considered.\n\nGiven these factors and comparing it to the previously known misery ratings, I would estimate that the misery rating for this story would likely be in the middle range. \n\nI think a reasonable rating might be around 50, which represents a significant level of discomfort and social implications without reaching the extremes of the highest ratings.\n\nMy final answer is {{{50}}}.",
    "4_1": "To evaluate the story \"You found a dead mouse inside your can of Red Bull after taking a sip and feeling something hit your lip,\" I consider the physical disgust and horror associated with this experience, as well as the potential emotional impact of ingesting something so disturbing.\n\nSince we need to provide a margin of 30 points for the rating, I will draw from the previously discussed misery ratings and make an educated guess.\n\nIf I assume this event carries a significant degree of discomfort and shock, I might estimate that the rating for this might be around the mid-50s to lower 60s range based on prior ratings. \n\nLet's presume the rating could realistically be around 58. Therefore, applying the 30-point margin above and below that:\n\n- Lower Level: 58 - 30 = 28\n- Higher Level: 58 + 30 = 88\n\nThus, I will state my final answer for the interval of ratings as follows:\n\nMy final answer is {{{28 - 88}}}.",
    "4_2": "In evaluating the story \"You Eat 2 Lbs of Your Own Hair which is then removed from your stomach by doctors,\" we must consider both the physical and psychological implications of this experience. \n\nEating a significant amount of hair poses serious physical risks and can lead to a painful medical intervention. The act of consuming one's own hair also likely carries a profound psychological component, potentially indicating a condition like trichophagia, which can lead to shame, embarrassment, and emotional trauma.\n\nBased on previous misery ratings, I would estimate that this story might have a misery rating in the higher range, potentially around the 70s due to the severe impact on both physical health and emotional well-being.\n\nFor the specific interval of 20 points:\n\nAssuming a rating of 75 as a reasonable estimate:\n- Lower Level: 75 - 20 = 55\n- Higher Level: 75 + 20 = 95\n\nThus, my final answer for the interval of ratings is:\nMy final answer is {{{55 - 95}}}.",
    "4_3": "To evaluate the story \"You Have One Happy Day in 129 Years,\" I would consider the profound emotional trauma and psychological impact of living a life filled predominantly with misery, with just a single day of happiness. \n\nThis scenario hints at severe long-term psychological effects, possibly rooted in depression or chronic sadness, with the single happy day likely representing an exception rather than the rule.\n\nBased on prior misery ratings and the nature of this story, I would estimate a rating in the higher range, reflecting significant emotional distress over the years with a small glimpse of happiness. A reasonable estimate might be around 80, given the extreme nature of the suffering involved.\n\nFor the specific interval of 10 points:\n- Lower Level: 80 - 10 = 70\n- Higher Level: 80 + 10 = 90\n\nThus, my final answer for the interval of ratings is:\nMy final answer is {{{70 - 90}}}."

This situation involves a violent act that would typically involve extreme physical pain, significant emotional trauma, and potentially serious long-term psychological consequences.\n\nGiven that being stabbed is a major violent act, it is likely to have a higher misery rating than having your home trashed.

The story about \"Your Son has sex with His Car\" seems to evoke a sense of bizarre misfortune, but it likely does not carry as much emotional weight or betrayal as a spouse's infidelity.\n\nI would rate the story somewhere between the two Hypothetical Situations, but closer to the lower end, as it embodies oddity rather than deep emotional trauma or severe physical pain.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{between}}}.",
    "1_2": "To address the current story, \"Your Bump N' Grind Burns You,\" I'll consider the ratings again. The first hypothetical maintains a misery rating of 36, and the second stands at 75.\n\nThis story seems to indicate a situation involving physical pain, likely related to some unfortunate intimate experience. However, it doesn't appear to reach the level of emotional trauma or betrayal indicated by the second situation involving infidelity. Given this context, it seems plausible that this story's rating falls higher than the first hypothetical but probably not as high as the second.\n\nBased on this analysis, my final answer is {{{between}}}.",
    "2_1": "To evaluate the two stories, \"Your Head Gets Stuck in Stair Railing Mid-Railing\" with a misery rating of 60, and \"You mistakenly became a getaway driver after a first date ended with a bank robbery,\" I need to assess the impact and the nature of each situation.\n\nThe first story likely includes physical embarrassment and potentially some physical pain, but it seems more humorous or light-hearted compared to serious infliction. The second story, however, involves significant emotional and possibly legal consequences, as being involved in a bank robbery, even by mistake, carries profound stress and life-changing ramifications.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems very likely that the second story would have a higher misery rating due to its serious implications.\n\nThus, my final answer is {{{higher}}}.",
    "2_2": "To analyze the two stories presented, we have \"Your Boyfriend Slept with Your Mom while on his way to meeting her,\" which has a misery rating of 66, and \"Your Son is Dating a Cockroach for a year.\"\n\nThe first story involves deep emotional betrayal and trauma, as it touches on relationships between family members and significant others, which can have serious long-term psychological impacts. This scenario carries a high level of emotional pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the second story about \"Your Son is Dating a Cockroach for a year\" is bizarre and absurd but lacks the same weight of emotional betrayal and trauma. While it may evoke feelings of embarrassment or concern for your son's mental state, it does not seem to reach the profound emotional pain of infidelity depicted in the first story.\n\nConsidering this, I would conclude that the second story likely has a lower misery rating compared to the first.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{lower}}}.",
    "3": "To assess the story \"An Entire Stadium of People Hates You,\" I consider the implications of widespread social rejection and humiliation. Being in a situation where a massive crowd collectively dislikes you can lead to intense emotional trauma and long-term psychological impact, possibly causing feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the emotional distress this scenario would likely cause, I would estimate the misery rating to be relatively high. Considering other stories and their ratings we've analyzed so far, I would estimate this story's rating to be around 85.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is {{{85}}}.",

The phrase \"virtually kills you\" suggests a significant emotional event or trauma, possibly involving betrayal or severe distress from the actions of a spouse. \n\nGiven that virtual actions can have real-life consequences, such as emotional pain, betrayal, or feelings of danger, I would estimate that this story carries a high misery rating due to the potential for deep emotional trauma.\n\nTaking that into account, I would estimate the rating to be in the range of approximately 70 to 90.\n\nThus, my final answer for the interval of ratings would be:\n\n{{{70 - 90}}}",
    "4_3": "To evaluate the story \"You fell into water & inadvertently got kicked in the face after trying to propose to your girlfriend while she was on a motorboat,\" we have to consider the elements of physical pain, embarrassment, and emotional disappointment involved in this scenario.\n\nWhile there is a comedic aspect to this situation, the physical pain from getting kicked in the face, along with the potential emotional impact of the failed proposal, would contribute to its misery rating. Given these factors, I would estimate that the misery rating might be in the range of about 40 to 50.\n\nTherefore, my final answer for the interval of ratings would be:\n\n{{{40 - 50}}}"
